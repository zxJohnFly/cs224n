You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never had chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell somewhere somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I was <unk> every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me enter the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret, it did.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand with me, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, the <unk> and take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that <unk> that I talked to you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked to you a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
It <unk> me around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on a <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when we fall out of glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't afford more and <unk> in a <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing his <unk> atmosphere.
As it melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these very unique moments there are only that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one following its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it's a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures that I would like to show you is from a iceberg I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of <unk> to actually see a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left one boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so they <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single woman is a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yes, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the pigeon chromosome is joined by the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that will be turned on two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people allocate the anatomy -- which is that human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say, <unk> <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into the male and female <unk>
At the general lines we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't get into the either male and a female <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and it says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors in testosterone, body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome?
So, there's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops in the course of a course of the course of the course of the course of a course of a course of a course of a course of a course of a course of the <unk>
When I <unk> the baby has <unk>
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not even about puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And after they tried to do tests that instead of having <unk> and <unk> has actually <unk> <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women like the men, we have in the body of something called the glands, <unk>
They're on the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- it doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> of <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 years old, born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, I was wearing a life like a guy and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the <unk> <unk> they were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems for the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that is happening.
So, there are many different varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- so that they are <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> is <unk> surgery. It's not to be able to have any better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to be a woman is to have a black identity -- it's going to be black, he wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture with <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children that are born like two people inside a body.
The most high school case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put his sex on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What do you do to do to figure out if <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to tell you the reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't penetrate a line line between men and women and women and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we are the ones we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought of them were a stable categories that were <unk> directly with categories of <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race -- something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology of it.
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you mean from the fact that they <unk> from them in just a few <unk>
And as we get in the science of the science we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today on the audience -- not in public, but I know when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to put it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of a pen in front of the nose, and if he was still <unk>
If he stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy as I am.
In politics I'm a liberal, we have people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gives me nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and bold in what they did, that I find every so much watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
And I knew that I was <unk> and I knew the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept -- and it was attached to another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remember, what we <unk> our parents, <unk> was the idea of <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be the political power for the right of blood passed the father to the father and then the son, and so on.
I knew it was rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered were the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it is very clear -- if you look at the history of Parents -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the Olympic explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be able to be passed through a <unk> idea of birth of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look up, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the bases of the future rights movement movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women's <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the middle of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to be <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to begin to ask why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say we should have <unk> to anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me, they have sense and I think we should be a <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep it and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I first time: June 1 in June 1 in 1980.
Henry, the other thing was born in the term: was born on the one of March June 1, 1980.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because she was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, the virtue of being considered to be considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> she would not have to worry.
Mary, in his hand, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have categories of categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science went so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where do we go from <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line on some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome. And so to marry a woman you have to have Y <unk>
Now in practice, they don't have tests that are attached to people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his "I am <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but on the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems like a good one."
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this to give people to people, because I will admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserves more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can be able to make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 to meet.
So how do you put the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this kind of thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian when a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> to be <unk> unless they are willing to have a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a few years ago that I had done to give birth twin twins and then pick up their fame.
But when the phone was asked by the surgery, he was a very famous operation, to tell me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of separation of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be the ones that are <unk> to change the very well.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or it might have been, if we had been given more involvement to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all -- but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have a interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> who knew that I was interested in Feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the smartest question I've heard.
Feminism has to be able to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about his question, more like there is something female-pattern in the <unk>
I mean, that there might be something on average, something different between the feminine brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I knew I knew they were very aware of the way to protect the people in the state, you may be able to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection from <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect link, think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily translate the world together, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But we just went through the local buildings alone.
So imagine that half the ones that you would like to live in apartments are already owners, and then on the other half still will not lack to do that.
You could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the construction distractions in the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go into a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building and always and when the rules of that place would be able to put <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to have new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities.
I later later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
Over the next elections, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we have <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
So through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and inconvenience all the current residents on apartments.
We put a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies as a set of norms for <unk> and they're usually the rules that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
He called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> land that, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in terms of very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that will give up the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included in an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that built in <unk>
Only this airport is about 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can deliver new choices for people.
There would be a city option that might be able to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away north.
And they also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help of <unk> countries that could benefit from the countries that would help them establish and make the <unk> rules so that everybody could be confident that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could be easily about 1,000 square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a decent willingness that allowed them to create these development areas.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress in the Congress is <unk> to one.
All of the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> the Constitution, has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17th, it passed over another voting voting on <unk>
Immediately after the voting on February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> is to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in Korea -- it's bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years after they spent four years old, getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it -- that's the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and they would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and developers who are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to go in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to be thinking about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that's that alive obsessed with <unk>
I love to find it, to find it, and more recently, photograph and post in my blog and <unk> <unk> and different for every day.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I'm going to go to meet people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> My view is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I'll love the color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
And inside a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after being here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know about the woman who walks for TED in my underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see a phenomenal amount of 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just let you give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child who has been inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the <unk> or I remind you with their little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key thing.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside there is no look like you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth, six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave a certain thing.
I don't need to be emotionally obsessed with these things, because the way around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I get it out.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
On the left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone that is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, who just like most of the other quantum traditions, we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar <unk>
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet on the playing with that bar of parking very valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of the physics -- some years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well into my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I should not be following the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't.
And so I would feel so much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here's what I'm going to broaden a little bit -- it's found right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a trampoline <unk> and that <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost as a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip chip new, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
So for the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole very <unk> in a swimming device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want them to eat them, or actually I don't want them to get it.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The classmates of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes around and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to <unk> to the quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
It turns out the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like something.
So we measure their motions.
We found that moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying still still, she was vibrating. And the way they <unk> was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that didn't go at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillion atoms make up that piece of metal that are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in particular <unk> when those are <unk>
The rest of the time are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one can only be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my <unk>
So just imagine if they were in various places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there on one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are really quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics that claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And so 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that he allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were going on with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and went to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to reality the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show the demo, to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all of the museums that there are.
There's the 3,000 gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the hall,
Come on. What is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the imagery.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10 billion pixel pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10 billion pixel pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started playing play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went into and discovered that the children were actually playing something.
I did a little bit of a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep and see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of a perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll really see what there is.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The <unk>
The example I showed it was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It goes up and it really is going to do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things more here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online to create your own museum, to create its own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, you go on -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just made a zoom in around.
This is the <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really didn't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they didn't even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice to your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the great question that make me today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk>
We call it what we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened very interesting in today's racing careers in the last two decades.
Whether some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what it is that, in engineering, it's <unk> control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the real time systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk> <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As one note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are getting into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for weekends during <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms to get sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end I took the hammer and he threw it into the Moses -- you can still see a little bit of <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what didn't you say?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember -- played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, eventually I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity that happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the River River.
It's the morning, before the game.
Time line is at the top.
At the early evening there are people around here and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a quick call go into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
earns Italy, yes!
That night everyone went to <unk>
There you see the big summit rate.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody else <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since <unk> <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse in a way that we didn't have to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know everything about the origin of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how does it be <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their change by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that would be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk> transport.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped not away, that is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle that we dropped a day still still still.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> valves who open and <unk>
It creates like a water curtain -- with pixels of water.
If the pixels fall the pixels you can write in them, show you patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it very much.
And we put a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows, but when you come up with it open so that you can see it.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody in the winter, when the roof, go down there, someone who was there, and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
This is working.
You see the <unk> people that go inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to get the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what a night when all sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that was still making slices and holes in water and you had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for interacting things that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
So imagine that those pixels could start flying.
So imagine that they could have little helicopters on the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before, that moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, we could form this cloud,
A flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal but three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position of the pixel down.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get near and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of today's <unk> today, the star of New York and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures in different <unk>
It's both <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can run all the way.
And once we have the pixels and we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could do that you can do it a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We have digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can see that we can move from the digital world of the <unk> power of networks, to physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how do we go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, by a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel up.
This is a physical structure in London, but cover <unk>
You can move through the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will be able to share the main moments of the main Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new <unk>
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than <unk>
Suppose you would tell you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be more <unk> to be stronger than you have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
What about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that most of them <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do we creativity?
Hands up, let me see you.
<unk> It's probably supposed to be the amount of creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Ah, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference -- but today I want to give you the eyes of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the Catholic Church -- he wrote an essay called "No biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: It's just about the past, or the future?
Does the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this field, right at one end, is of course, the more interested in it.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval, there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its most most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is the same protein that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take on the more bacteria that the cells we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> I asked you the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, inside.
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you can want to want to have no effort to be able to be able to want without any effort on their own.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria to the occasional disruption of some rush hour into the way.
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is kind of like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when the organisms come up, the things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing -- with the onset of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body enters evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death on the time, it seemed rather reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits the door of a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, he's found a gorgeous light dancer in his clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"It says George, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get me healthy.
I wanted to save health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about moving the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
So from an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us drop to the sea.
I think that all <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to give you <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily experience longevity.
They don't necessarily play the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the most intelligent ones.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and successful.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish in the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what is happening in evolution, and if we go back to thinking about human beings in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking that would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be fit to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that we have evolution happen.
One second possibility is that you create an evolution of traditional traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> when the species -- planets are going to exist, the isolation, and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility, a delicious possibility and terrifying possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
Just consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think about it as if it could be able to be able to choose not only sex in your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and he's 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 and a week.
Not much for us to do a lot of the human genome is actually going to make the human genome for <unk> and to be increasingly in the reach of all.
They come out of those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against the flu vaccine, in a plant of <unk>
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
So imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life opportunity to remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, the same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also adopt a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of applying this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, let's <unk> <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
Let's build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So immediately I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
That's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words are more <unk> than ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I wanted to have and never come back.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that rabbi that really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the <unk> the George Washington Bridge, which was not much -- I thought about, "Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry the time it was going to be in things that didn't care with people I know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason I don't try to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> by 14th <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I am saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I said, I had the feeling of, "Oh, wow, not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell me, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a <unk> performance -- not much of a lot of artistic talent --   and I scream, <unk> like a little bit.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I gave me a miracle, I didn't die of that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You know, you are flying today, the challenge you can think the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you get it?
What is the thing that they <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy.
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation -- so obviously, graffiti is something that we <unk> and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I only want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you have seen Stephen <unk> not that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are an important person and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Somebody to see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they're going <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I introduced myself to the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how he was going to <unk>
I was excited with his brother and father there at that precise moment, so "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have both in your inner can't afford it.
So I talked at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that enables them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw over that and record negative space.
So they're going around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with the sex organs, then with the bad words with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so I started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much to move the things on one side to another we'd achieved a couple of things.
One, I played the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that he could be able to call it a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And, seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to you with the guy gets an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> ride my son as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a pair of low-cost sun glasses that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera here, the <unk> we put it on a light of LED LED -- and now there's a device that is free -- we released the code -- we published the DNA code, the software is low in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating with just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you -- that was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this picture is the other person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of planning, about all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email to us, and this was what he said, "This was the first time to draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to come to her and get me out there so I could get it out.
It's not <unk>
And in a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go down with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of an Blank.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to get it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money on this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> in Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty awesome.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with a <unk> technology technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited about some wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you to do all the days when we find ourselves with something that we feel that we have to do. If it's not right now, you know, if I am not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations very hard and at the same time as dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a <unk> <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this fun -- a lot of fun in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a great part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations that have been horrible with the only goal to try to look at social questions in ways that we need to be <unk> interesting, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have any idea what it comes and as the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't have done with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the marketing world.
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could happen to me -- it could be <unk> for something so difficult or as dangerous as you enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film is <unk> with <unk> of innovative and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The greatest <unk>
The thing that happens in "The greatest <unk> ever <unk> is that everything above top of the end, has a brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title, the brand <unk>
Now this brand, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we had all the categories that we could in the film.
You may have a shoe -- a shoe and become the most cool shoe that you have.
The most cool car has ever driven in "The greatest <unk> ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The greatest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- all the film -- from beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to <unk> it is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you think -- it's very <unk> but you know how it is going to be <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: It's a million and a half a half and a half <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big events.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that film comes to us, we look at it as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be difficult for the film or to be I?
JK: So two things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So I love myself, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought I was <unk> it meant we have a concrete conversation.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and the stage of the separate media -- it's not the idea of that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
It was actually not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google --  -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily detected or <unk> that are characterized by the visibility.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> the president of the <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it, it changes suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency day --  -- like that weird bear who still still still continues to.
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> history.
We want to make it a story, but we have <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in some lie -- and there he is staring at me like <unk> said, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my account, I would have to take away and go to the business, I would have to go to the business of my team.
So what I started to notice from a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies -- the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant movies and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies like <unk> giants, they say the reason why their movies have so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The greatest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically at the film?
Every time I get out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you "Are you very cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you make you care?
Maybe you should put you a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there we offer one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have both of them for man to be like for solid, solid, <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look general.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
We put the sort of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the guy from the street, to the people like me, the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define you the <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk>
<unk> Something unique -- <unk> Man: I guess the gender type, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
Usually I wear <unk> as <unk> or I like the <unk> and the way.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of these, in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
They have <unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because I read the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> failed.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can not all be an Tom, but I was often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of it be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me that world.
MS: That world? And I believe that your world is the world that you <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next is this is the best day in my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what does it do that?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> are you right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. What kind of Russian mountain.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk>  Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy madness in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but let's put it into your personality of <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was <unk> very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies are only focused on one of their strong items or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid the fear, those elements and you actually make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands is this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands now -- those things that have gone and come -- but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS:
If someone asks you to take your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you are someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> rapid or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic like <unk>
Or are you more of <unk>
You're mindful of sophisticated <unk>
You're a <unk> traditional place, <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, and wise people like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they had no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how they are now using MRI MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain as well for commercial marketing in the brain as well.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden advertising to the air.
In all the city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> there is nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the way in the schools with available cancer problems.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or when I have more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to the film that was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has now started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talk about is to tell their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you pull people out of that that's pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of risk is preparing their entire company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we have to give it the fear of fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately we have to get transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my <unk> talk, the <unk> has been presented for my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So I would get in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket. I have a check on the name of the MIT Lab, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my <unk> for the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> <unk> is really simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we have to compromise these systems that are <unk> speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer using an engineer, to set up this gray, so we're ready.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a <unk>
<unk> enters the gray box, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how to find this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these <unk> systems.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were doing our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they were very strange.
<unk> was <unk> as a <unk> rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after I experienced with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: right?
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could you be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
And let's get all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you heard the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code code.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much at the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to engage them with the real world, with potential real-world goals.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a <unk> white, and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They are not several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called it and I went to you in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of <unk>
There is that mobile part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an effort to make the nest engineers, so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't get <unk>
I started researching scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That was meaning, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And it wasn't like this.
The results have been from after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> were going to one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just showed up, really <unk>
That's the gray, and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of the sensors -- for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors -- which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds with <unk> video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not be fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes off speed, you have to open full escape into a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of <unk> <unk>
We put it as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with a huge number of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we are going to make it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My mind is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the informal superpower, of this.
There's one only, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give it a little bit of <unk> or another thing to make users from lawn chairs and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force -- which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and it can integrate it with the universe and with other <unk> things?
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to carry on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> getting even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injury on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton -- I can take it 90 pounds of new land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I think what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the look at the users of the wheels, what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, on the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with very often a very young people, with damage in the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is going to be multiply quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication. -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19, 19 years ago, and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years to now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors in it.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also a batteries that give the energy energy from the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural way?
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, turning it down to the bottom of the air, <unk>
On a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything moving out into <unk>
Shortly later, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, "You never get to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down the bottom of it, climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change your life to future generations -- not only soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the <unk> world of rainforests in Congo.
<unk> are along with the chimpanzees, their closest lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has taken for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade and deforestation make you not be able to fill not a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world -- honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter, <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as apes as the apes -- the love, not <unk> because they have frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> to deal with conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the play is fundamental to create links and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game. You see the roots in the same laughter, the dance, the dance and the human ritual <unk>
The game is the glue that came to us.
I don't know how they play but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't talk about football.
Here is a female and a male male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we put this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things to unusual elements of the game -- like <unk> -- and also how play requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female female -- who is playing with fresh water.
I think that as it, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a world more difficult for bigger and bigger cooperation.
The secret is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take the most of our ability of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human beings, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When you look at the least appropriate play, you can be the most urgent moments of the <unk>
So they were primates, for us to accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires up as a captain of a captain in a body of firemen <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are facing a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But still, there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in your <unk> while his house was on flames.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go out and would save the dog owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live <unk> just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need the home.
I need you to be able to <unk> the fire, and then bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what waiting was waiting for but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firemen that at the most or less ended the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house for the owner of the house where, as it was to expect, his trove was much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the house owner by the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she watched for the other was that somebody had reached her even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a voluntary fireman is witness by acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It has all its importance.
So when I look at this room to people that have ever achieved, or are you to get to -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: I don't know.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit of <unk> now.
We put food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of a fixed measure of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> did this happen.
It was called it <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks.
It's estimated that they've been made more than 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> it made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> world of <unk> to a <unk> world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together with magnets.
So you cannot be able to be able to be wrong.
The bricks have a colored code.
The green is the road, blue is the stream, the rose and the orange color is the wire and the orange color.
So you just have to put together a blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with one green make light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact and have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having a program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make <unk> faster or more slow or <unk> you can just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to get together to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is, how do you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how do you work a night of night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken care of design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the designers at the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which they have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Do you do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is very afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go to the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is us.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
Economic collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> <unk>
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I'm already given the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like some <unk> of Peace <unk>
We had a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> to the Third World we send it to the wild world <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Here it comes up as if I was looking for a quote, but what it really looks for is someone to clean it when you get to the snow because it knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help of this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February, and at that moment we would spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that citizens had <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can adopt a <unk>
One is embracing <unk> when you <unk>
And when you do that, you put a name, in this case put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a component problem?
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk> technology.
And it spreads down.
A responsible for systems of <unk> city to see this app realized that I could use it not to the snow, but for the citizens to take <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of the tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens of the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people go out to clean sidewalks out when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that will be used to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural <unk>
If you know a bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that it had done by the normal channels that would have taken at least two and five million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the power of California in California that is going down 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that gets program in a couple of days, and it spreads into viral form is a kind of <unk> to the institution of government.
It suggests to the better ways to work, not like in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not like a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to deal with the issue of the government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an astronomical institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications -- every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they didn't have the <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone doesn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government in the last instance made out of -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to pick people out to choose to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of mobile care service and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand a <unk> brand in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the foundation of official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, and put it very hard music and see if it <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that's not the end of the <unk>
So Boston does not have a call center.
It has a website and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They don't accept that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my trash bucket -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
And the next report, he said, "I first found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
And I went around the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet time."
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to distributed distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for the people to get themselves and help others.
So, an citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
He connected the two people.
And it could have connected with the government services of being needed but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another neighbor to each other, we <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think you're the entrance to the other.
So our input to the government system is vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will save our values and make our values and make our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an enormous ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
At the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that that actually belongs to that that we funded as something that is going on in our against, that other thing, and a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
Have you <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have contributed to the government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the massive challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so it can be able to expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> we only have to articulate the <unk>
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be, everybody will talk.
They can express your opinions on any channel at the same time and they do.
So when we face the government problem with no matter how to do hear their voices.
They're using hands.
They set up the work to program applications that make them work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> out of a <unk> taking a bucket of junk that has a trash inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is to me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent the most part of my life in <unk> communities, in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here is impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was hard was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the whole thing in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was a little <unk> and I would look at it, and I was getting a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then let me angry.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was moving back and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
It had this human quality that I would always wish to wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that it had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at it, and he was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went down into the room, and he said, "Come to me, "Come to me, "Come to me, <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me out and he said, "You know, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you a <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I know that I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, and he looked at me, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, I <unk> I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want to do is that you will always do the right thing -- although the right thing is it <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I am."
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want to do is that I never get to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the <unk> I have a brother and a older year a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package of six <unk> I didn't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's wrong there? Take a <unk>
He landed on the <unk> and she was saying, "Oh, not be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can tell you I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't mean this is a <unk> I mean it by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't see any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my naturally naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it, and we should have <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was 40 years ago.
<unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the U.S., we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of the three black men in the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In the urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles Philadelphia, Baltimore to 60 to 60 percent of all the young color of color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is very much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not any of our own.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some developments well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you care about rights because you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely missing the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of the loss of rights to be so high as it was before they <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where children were sentence for 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country in jail for kids, without the possibility of getting away.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This is a death penalty issue.
In some sense they have been told to think that the ultimate question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about to decide whether people deserve to die by cyber attacks, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death sentence in the United States is defined by mistake.
Of every nine people who have been identified -- one that is innocent and released from the death row of death.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not allow you to be able to run airplanes if every nine that they <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It is interesting that in my class with students in <unk> history I talk about the slavery today.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding and it lasted to the Second World War.
Really, we don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was sort of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were concerned to be <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you doubt about talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with the <unk> and decades of race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all the time we can do with each other.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage them with a real process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome the <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was in Germany on the death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's pretty disturbing to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "No way that with our history, we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> put us to <unk>
It was <unk> about this.
How would we feel like a nation like Germany, beating people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, but <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. Help us understand creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
So lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, in spite of being <unk> so committed to intellectual,
With innovation, with creativity. It is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the <unk>
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will for the spirit, a will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, is still in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we do all of these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together and just to speak.
Occasionally, the lunch lady called me -- and I was called the <unk> lady, we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I know I do."
And so she said, "Well, what do you do when I <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was a very <unk> thing.
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks led to me and said, "Now, I have a show for me that this idea of <unk> justice is.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> for life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and he looked at me and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lying, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that's not <unk> it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one -- it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's how it is.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> not to judge by our technology, by our designs, and our intellectual capacity or rational.
In the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but because of the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what is not it?
The judge was going to be used as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was going, <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't have to have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> has powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14-year-old customer -- a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my 14-year-old man from 14 to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line of how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a sleep, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had it; it was sent to the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go through this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came out of the car. He went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man who was <unk> <unk> <unk>
When he saw me, he came up to me, "Who's you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
And so I came up and approached me.
And I stood up in the ear, in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And I started here."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops came up with the prosecutors the prosecutors are <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and we were qualified because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> I had to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look out of the window and be able to hear all that <unk>
He <unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, with the face of concern, I went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was going to have a <unk>
During the break of the <unk> I just showed you, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the black man stood up on the foot, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> audiences to tell this young woman to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human, if we don't care about human rights, and because of dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Which is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to make the funds that spend today in punishment today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years, billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the homicide cases didn't see in <unk>
<unk> of rapes are not at all.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there is a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
Great growth in this country is not about crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
This is why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to a supply chain, to rob a bicycle, per small crimes of property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
I think that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing per anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats by Bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> three: <unk> O.C. <unk>
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk>
<unk> 6: Holy <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Several <unk> War, a massive <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than the brain probably can be taught.
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So of course, of a <unk> stories to look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news to give us negative news, 24 hours a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues, the climate change, the extinction extinction of species, the scarcity of water, and we have no doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income of inflation has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food to the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, "No <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have been dreamed of <unk>
It was a lot of the technology -- and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and it's doubling the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile reason you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and the bad time, in the war, and in <unk> in <unk> in depression and <unk>
It's the resulting computer that we used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping before any big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it's moving up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count today.
So the computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computation, sensors and networks, and the 3D printing and their ability to democratize personalized production throughout the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and food, and the food, the digital medicine <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory of <unk> <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline they <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to humans."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for every cell phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students -- and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect positive affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking this thing that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
Tell dinner to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops with covered with silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the Washington Washington Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he came up with the <unk> and he made the aluminum stuff that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's put this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about hobbyists and <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated of generated <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents the <unk> compared to the 15 cents on the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan wrote the spacecraft Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
And we had a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, <unk> two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> but also there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to deal with your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator one.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water by the day of any <unk> water <unk> <unk> water, for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that I will make a important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that so that would be, Coca-Cola is to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications <unk> in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan just 25 years ago.
And by having a smart mobile phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, technology -- <unk> diagnostic technology now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when it comes to the health app.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we have these technologies in a mobile device that they talk, and because it has <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are health care workers.
When this device <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic happening.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just spent the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been before you get to the global conversation.
What are these people going to want these people?
What do you do? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of the story.
These people are tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And most health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three million more members of mankind, healthy educated and <unk>
What about voices never before before.
What if we give communities wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small equipment for their passion with a goal of of course, you can do things -- things that they could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important to medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this for college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went around and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to be able to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we need to do.
We have over in front of the extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught it a lot until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still go to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in Western Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned too much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 feet a black beard, <unk>
And fishing from this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so I was getting more than the average one in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went down to the five centimeters tall.
It was a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
That is nothing to changed, but it has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The development development was able to impose up the countries that were already <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now yes, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny little <unk> the remains of the remains of a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing fishing.
The bottom of being a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
They didn't have the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living alive.
I was still not <unk>
Then they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains of the remains of the fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But you have no <unk>
We don't remember the world but we don't remember it.
And then you get the point of starting the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, quantity of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use the images of the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and how they extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the measure of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that, in fact, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very ubiquitous, before we <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose the little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
You have a few fish -- but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they're going to do it because the evidence presented in a way before it is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like that captain such as a captain of the fish in this area cannot be used -- or typically we don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in oppressive societies, because they don't rely on sources of the past.
Out of the enormous role that can deliver a protected marine area.
Because with the marine <unk> we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has been run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which enables them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Middle <unk> for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made viral ones, and what matters has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- it seemed very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper sets up in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
There are more than 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a little percentage is a viral percentage of a huge amount of visits and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: the creators of unintended communities of participation and factor.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside his house in <unk> National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> at the bottom of popularity last summer.
<unk> didn't say to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already posted a lot of videos from nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would give up the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> present and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on the Friday.   Everybody wants to get on the weekend, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> on the Friday.  KA: Don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos in the year.
We saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends will take a view of view, and share it with a smaller audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or do something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an automatic animation.
That's the whole thing.
This year we saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that awakened between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of the old version.
And then the international did.
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this would happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form in.
Because today it's not just <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or P, Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written by that <unk>
In a world where two days of video are going up two days per minute, just the only one and unexpected thing can tell you the way these things have done that.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that <unk> against <unk> in New York, I admit, I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I'm going to focus on the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you properly through the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative communities of participation, the completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of culture, to the one that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of fear.
As I said before, one of the celebrity current in the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media, but we will have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> entered <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time friends, let me get it out.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat by <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to be a <unk> task and escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat was slid into the sea of ship ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were to wake up, we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast range and vacuum.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights on the oil platform, in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I'll finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried to, because of the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English is <unk> between the people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked at farms, then in a <unk> line of cars, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT in <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and the extra mentoring in English and mathematics, he didn't matter what you should be supposed to be, which was generally <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was rare and <unk> over the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
Come home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would tell us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's <unk>
My mother was suffering from the boat.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares are starting to be able to be able to be able to be able to get it out.
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry angry and <unk> boys -- trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student, relentless with what they <unk> from myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in life lives, rather than violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I chose the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
As <unk> resident anonymously in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, <unk> and houses whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for about 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got into the boat.
That had never been an option.
He said, "Well, you're not going to be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> in the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I really talked about, the more I was talking about to speak to.
I met people of all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a newborn new in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it may easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that they hadn't been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a power there, a broken optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
It was attached to a little group of people who the motto is unable to <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but a few bright ones, and we open ourselves up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
after a journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and taking the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it just to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel room, when she was killed, 1,000 miles, in <unk>
I looked across the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Since the people who we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives that would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could I wish that for it?
But I fear the privilege of the easy thing about the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> <unk> in every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the <unk> mother is now here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed from the old <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and drop the sky.
We now do it with airplane.
At that time when I <unk> the great prince Indian Indian <unk> he had <unk> he pulled an arc and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the machinery with this.
And that was very much <unk>
Every time I was feeling a little bit more <unk>
I was <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technology was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury <unk> and the cameras keep that <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how it would be used to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we got the book.
Where do we are.
<unk> the text with the image, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, "You know, your fingers about getting light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back to a character of the book.
At a number of moments it comes to me -- the iPad knows where I live, thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood as to those ideas that we love with children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always so exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And, really, they light your way into what anybody's doing."
Another idea that fascinated me was a little girl in a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world turns into a <unk> that I drag it into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there has always been aesthetic maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it is also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content and in contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were from India -- they know their counterparts who are <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a particular child history.
In a story that deals with the current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our children into the natural world with their technology.
So one of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the <unk> variations between magic, Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we have to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and it turned on and through augmented reality and through augmented reality. You see a <unk> group that appear on inner plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves in a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are attached to technology and magic and technology comes to each other.
We have the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and we are moving into the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I really believe that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to the patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University was <unk> to a CEO of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee, or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to listen to listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale, it's very simple.
It has a traffic doorknob and on.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time in which I need to do it, or some emotion of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> -- I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity activity, to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available for the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take people out from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they will support their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to <unk> control, and to be captains of their own <unk> but also helping us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things that we did want to share it with you with a video here.
We all have the controls controls in the <unk>
We may have in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where today's ATMs in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food supply.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please look at it, and when it's open, because when it is open, because they sometimes open in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> we already submitted in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use his cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what it can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to make ourselves a global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows up is still in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was awakened with my first digital camera for the 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but was a little bit different because when I used the camera that process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more than to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when we press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful <unk> but with the common goal of keeping the art level.
And when I say art? I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
So let me have to think about a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
They're the details or the <unk>
Take the light?
What is the thing that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about how we interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way, can make something that still seem to be <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's turn into the brain because the brain doesn't support the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process when we combine the photographs.
It really consists of combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seems like it seems like a realistic photo of those in which we don't even get the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to tell you that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not quite special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images have been taken out of the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that is easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter, I knew that it had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured on a stone.
And yes, I even made the red house from the island of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take a good job when you take the photos the result may be very beautiful and a very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only edge is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring technology.
Please, if you can <unk>
This is a diagram anybody I took on a mine.
I'm not very interested to show you the details but the general looks like.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other ones that we usually see, is a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm talking about technology with <unk> <unk> is something new.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve, where, let's say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It's not very much.
But if you take a example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve would be very dumb -- we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the <unk> transport technology as fast as the <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years is increasing orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't stay forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
We put one of two things.
Or will you be able to turn into a typical curve, and I know this until it comes out totally different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, "What is that new way that embraces the world?
What new state is <unk>
The transition seems very, very confusing if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year in my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate that we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, what could be that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot of technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at the long term.
The time scale that I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a couple of two billion years ago when the Earth was a huge sterile rock with many chemicals that would stick around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals organized it, we give us a sense of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was a little bit floating out of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical prescriptions inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them into the outside of the outside and the drops and they grew up grew to them.
And they started <unk>
In some sense, those were the more <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those droplets were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time it <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time of bringing the chemists to the <unk> they would save more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was very simple, and the things are interesting to be interesting when these drops the trick of abstraction.
So somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save the information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this particular evolution of writing that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to be able to be able to make it out.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same <unk> system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide the security security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and it took it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it into a virus and would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy to be happy another billion years.
But then another big step in the place that things were going on very different -- and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can swap DNA.
So for example, for example, has evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resilient to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
In that <unk> way, or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community -- more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities were approaching so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community of the community in a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting for life took other billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities that are emerging communities of many different kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the brain of the brain, or so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels that cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process in the community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible for <unk> understanding and conveying information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because they knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built, these material processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that it accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most important version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting there, emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing that we turn it into sound, into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That lets us start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods that show and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years to each other.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
And yet, the language, the language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the more you do it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life design by designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer.
But now design objects of such a complexity that would be impossible for me <unk>
I don't know that it does every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the <unk> designers we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine that does something that I didn't could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they have methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the middle of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these random instructions at random to run all of those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to answer numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more coming into the order of numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be a random sequences.
But one, luckily, could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they best did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now we are going to get the ones that better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to a process of analog analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and that the children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please do the <unk>
Go back again.
So let's have some mutations here.
And it tries again and try another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in <unk> cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are moving numbers in such a perfect way.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to run it to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
I once went into a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster computers, and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
So it is <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog moment by analog organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I will stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent the time enough to allow me to give a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before we treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you have heard of.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that will kill 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and anyone who tries to take care of the first base -- not to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three of 10.
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone in 10 <unk> I get around.
<unk> like the legendary Williams, the last player of the League of <unk> from <unk> in <unk> in a regular basis.
Now let's get this to my medical world where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place, and a dear to have two <unk> <unk> arteries has two <unk> <unk> and their family doctor is derived by a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But do you know anything?
She is getting better at a year that year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But they would ask them to do.
What do you believe that you must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse or from a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would find myself with the mandate to be perfect.
You would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a Protestant <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studied to a blood test.
Such a which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
Of my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> diagnostic and not standard.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnostic of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if you were to put everything, then you would know everything, or as much as possible, I was close to everything, because I love it for the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident at a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady in the emergency room where I worked in the emergency room of the emergency hospital.
I was given to the service of <unk>
And when I applied it to a cardiologist I would have to go to the patient with me.
And he would report the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, heart leaves and, instead of pump the blood into the forward, the blood goes to lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there is difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't difficult for <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about it.
I gave it <unk> and medication to relieve the pressure on his heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home to his house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't wake up the phone and did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him so that the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring some information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident going to pay attention to it.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even wearing my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And when they sent her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so safe, so until I asked the nurse that I was talking to the lunch lady, "Do you believe it is okay if it goes to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think it's okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that the tall, and the ambulance on the ambulance room took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I would be able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do yet.
I went through the emergency room at home.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one, he said to me, three words, those three words that most emergency doctors are <unk>
Other specialists fear the people as well, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see <unk> patients.
The three words is: Do you remember it.
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her high school, he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance that brought them to emergency with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a severe severe.
I just didn't breathe and was blue.
<unk> personnel -- all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and waiting against all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that we never get to.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they went into what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left him go. wife, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names you die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was excited about it, and I experienced it for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I was just just <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
shame is that I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong inside.
It's the one that tells us that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that made it.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure to get the things out and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I tell my <unk> Why was he sent to your house?
And in my worst man, why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Little at the feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on a <unk> day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me that if you put the efforts to be perfect for no more errors, I would try to cease these voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the community hospital in the community in the community in the Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I noticed his throat, I noticed a little bit <unk>
I was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, she was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked to speak with me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words, it remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
So he came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but on the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He fortunately, she didn't die.
You would be able to get antibiotics on it, and it's recovered for the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency room -- not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they went down to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's a <unk>
One of them I thought I had a unified <unk>
You put an X-ray shot, but it turned out normal a colleague that was checking the patient into a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I read it.
And I looked at it and when I noticed a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon <unk>
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every single case I was passionate about me, <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get me and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- wherever I would have a hard time in looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
Your total denial of mistakes.
It is the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that do not sleep, and the ones that do not sleep, and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and personal journalism -- I've done a very bad study of medical litigation and failures to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, in which one in 10 drugs that are happening in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> it's not correct. In a system where infection infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24 thousand Canadian <unk> for errors that were <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get it out.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in your chest, and she comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and, suddenly my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the things all the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals more likely to error, well, not to be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art, <unk> is the custom of my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the chief of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah blah blah, "What are your <unk> And let's put the microphone into it.
And their students were <unk> <unk> will go back to your head and <unk> and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
We could say, "Look, we don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> <unk> is human, they accept it, they accept it and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn what happened to teach others.
They had their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their errors.
<unk> the errors of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everyone <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at the time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, I'm a human <unk>
And I feel so much but me to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I would remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk> day.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick a half a half a half a day.
It didn't do a long time, in a research week to a group of business companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks -- by these executives and the time that we are trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Now naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those choices took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How did they first grade the way that we deal with those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear the problem of the overload of <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this conference on a very, very <unk> level at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and <unk> and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we took water from <unk>
I loved to go to that tent, but I was like, why did I never buy anything?
This is the oil shelf from <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Do you have this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with your cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
You put a post for <unk> right at the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors -- and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
When I stopped when I had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
When they stood when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six. If they found 24.
Well, what do we decide that we don't buy <unk> probably less is good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices affects us in <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from a few plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available to their savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the more of the funding was the number of funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at extreme ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer a <unk> the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there is unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of options, more people will be able to avoid stocks or the funds of investment.
As soon as they had more choices, they were more willing to invest at market financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the early decade we've seen three key negative consequences to the more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, that the <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it really wrong.
The main reason is that we put it with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparing them to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
So today, I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first one is <unk>
You already heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, than more is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space on the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you decide to be able to cut, get rid of <unk> strange options, there will be a <unk> increase in sales -- the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a rise of 10 percent in sales.
When the <unk> Golden <unk> eliminated the products to be <unk> of cats that are less <unk> increased <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and lower costs.
You know that today's supermarket bank is 45 products.
In a store of Walmart being offered about 100,000 products.
But the nine largest store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a tomato tomato kind of tomato sauce.
In the financial savings world I think that one of the best examples that have emerged about how much choices have come to do the choice of the choices is the <unk> <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a certain amount of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
They already know that people are often saying, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer the people of this audience a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful highway road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want they to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds for <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, than in the second thing, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the <unk> of the <unk> of choices, which is <unk>
And so people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very very, very concrete, very carefully.
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to be able to make people better.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that it was given to the staff who would think about the positive things that I would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories that options.
For example, this is a study that we did at a <unk>
What we saw is that in the supermarket <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the magazines can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Okay, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know anything?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to you who is not going to be aware of the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge <unk>
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think about if we just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a <unk> decision buying a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that enables it to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these choices vary in the number of options that offers each other.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order that decisions make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, at a few hundred boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from <unk> options, four to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about it involved in there.
If you are <unk> the <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices at a few ways, put the default button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was to disrupt the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we pick the box of changes not to say nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful time we can be in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years, in the East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that I had to write to the government.
You had to record a leaf text sheet, written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of texts.
If they were written with the wrong message you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much that this is <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few little printed dots on every page that makes a pattern that makes it one and your printer.
That is happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can set up the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks for a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of online <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, they were <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in important that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, and it motivating the protests, they motivate them to motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who make it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national United States governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the bottom last fall because of a <unk>
We put the safety of the site and create a <unk>
And last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people to cause <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an aquatic authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why is the <unk>
Well, you need to do if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority authority.
And that was going on with <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters based on the Swiss secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> they found a lot of papers.
The guy was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was some notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale the communications of the citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for the <unk> government to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So the Western governments provide them tools to the governments that do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a bad criminal case -- it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
We have even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why did we care?
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's playing privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we will have today, will be forever.
Would you see in any future government in a administration we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be concerned about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows from my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cow, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no burden in the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to outside the park.
And predators, as the lions are, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it very bad because it was the only thing that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with the lions.
People were people who protect our community and livestock and livestock and are also angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I believe that there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
One child in my community, of six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of their father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought of lions giving them fear.
But I realized that it actually didn't be <unk> because I even helped lions see the <unk>
I don't get rid of <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions to believed that they were near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they came out, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I jumped in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't meet.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which it turns out and turning the lights.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk>
They put it all.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity into the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> you get out there, because that's where lions.
And that's how they see it, lions come from night.
The lights are <unk> and we have the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went back to having problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants as well.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights into the homes that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying planes and told me that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come into an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer, and a pilot when they grow.
I used to hate lions but now like my invention is saving the cows of my father and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to listen to a story like yours.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical fields.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of electric <unk>  One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, you know, just once, right now, right now, and I have tried it before, but I had tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the <unk> Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to get it on every step that I would get my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I was very proud.
In school, we would build all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> history, but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, and Japan is the enemies.
Although sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When we put this, the five family members of the family will leave there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks last weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At little time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was on the street, holding a child in his arms in his arms looking at his mother and watching nothing.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
An enormous famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and just a few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy bills, all of me was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, just across the river from my home.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river may be very <unk> in certain points, enabling North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how to go out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had been accused me by being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese <unk>
These women had very lucky.
Although there were it eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and went to North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans not so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and finding work, all their world can be done in an instant.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take a risk to South Korea to South Korea to me.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much more challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea -- it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started to study for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent my family, and, as well as my family was going to be shifted to the force to a place in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China, and I went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for more than 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and done by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did the whole way to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and locked up the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and locked up in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the poorest spots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family for me.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and then to get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the <unk> town.
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown is a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when they were more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community is really the rays of hope that the <unk> people needs it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language, and do it and more.
We can also act like the bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in touch with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is Center for <unk> shops <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the South Pole name, so it represents something else, so they changed it to South Los Angeles as if this is <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles and <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans, in a food desert in a food desert -- Los Angeles and home of the food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that places of food to carry kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was trying to see this happen.
And I ask myself, what would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold like self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my home.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters x 3 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it to.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me at <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this was how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, nine full vegetables.
What we do is, we are a kind of paid paid money from all the <unk> of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city got me on top and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made command <unk>
And I was like, "Come on, you know, right?
A court order, by planting the food on a piece of land that nobody else --  And so I was like, "Well, let's look at it.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has <unk> <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central people.
That's enough space to plant billions of blood plants.
Why on earth does the hell do you don't seem well this?
We put a plant to a <unk> 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars to be a result.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, you're growing your own food.
You put your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up with my children there.
I became aware of this <unk> reality that was <unk> to me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I built my art.
Just like an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, I took soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if they leave their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You see how to see the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time, he came up with a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> on the night and they were in my yard, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people that was so close to me hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to be <unk>
So that's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the same time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refuge in the heart of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've got, like about 50 people who come from, they work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you are not taught how the food affects the mind and body, eat blind than they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're interested in these color guys that are on this way designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you make the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block from gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people to work to people, pull the kids on the streets, who know the joy and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk> is.
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take them to them, take their <unk> OK?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me -- they don't call me and you want to look at the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains very much.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt thing that we <unk>
And especially if they go on your bicycle and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make roads out of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so all the water water flow toward the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
Noise also disappeared in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it is a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface of the surface.
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and so on, and you can do that --  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not going to be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so you only have a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they fall down, they're going to be <unk> and they'll separate from <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the wool and steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of wool wool into it.
And then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially the steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks it back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> oven because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tested a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> highway, where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we put it a lot of burden on them, and we put them a lot of burden on them, and we put them together and we went back to it.
We can repeat this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the surface of the surface. It really will save a lot of money with very simple things.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts the repair.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember given me one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radius of it.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now I know you can go to a <unk> school."
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were thrown out of Afghanistan and they made the girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was struck by a child to put my older sister to my older sister that I couldn't be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we would make a different route so that no one could suspect to be <unk> where do you start?
We had to hide the books on business bags so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it was extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we had our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. They found that his daughter, my mother was to the school, and that's why his father did it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was moved two years ago, just to turn our house home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, "You know, my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can get it to leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that always will be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud of college at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who I carry him on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
This is why they <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as the mine, <unk> for them, even though in front of an informal opposition.
As a <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally, they escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
And when you get to his house, they're the phone, a voice <unk> that if they kept sending his daughter to school, they would get back to try.
<unk> already, if he <unk> he said, "but no harm the future of my old daughter and <unk> ideas."
What I've noticed in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of their daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school has been <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so we realized that these changes didn't last last long after the retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, which <unk> I see a future <unk> and change change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls from <unk> I would give it up.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the revolution broke out of the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and out of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the middle, the fall of the regime, carrying billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a sexy courage to deal with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East, East to the west, the south.
Finally, after a six months of <unk> war, and about 50,000 of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved a lot of other women, to rebuild the civil society -- <unk> <unk> a progressive transition and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about capabilities development, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and for our right to work with the <unk> of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was more and more <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was going and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in 52 years.
However, a little bit of a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day woken up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the heart attack.
Another day introduced us to the news of the murder law of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations and their lack of law.
Our society, made up of a <unk> mindset -- more than the ideals and the early freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all to <unk> with our success history of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because elections didn't have peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and self-determination.
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creation of consensus more than it needed to be the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the gender representation of the female more than needing the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an antibody agents and call it to anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also put the difference in practice, rather than <unk> collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately desperately needs the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in existential ways before we do it in <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which embraces all the humanity of that that men and women, which all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows in the inside, the divine matrix, of compassion <unk> all the existence.
And this is what is like, "My strawberries is <unk>
So this is what is like, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
They were all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a unified question, which has an answer equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of the domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone is doing is why she is left?
Why was it going to be somebody going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, or expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, he had been <unk> at the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me to the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets of <unk>
The man, I loved more than anybody in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a spiritual <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for the <unk> list of the checklist <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black man, white <unk> a <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can pass on anyone, all the races, all of religion -- every single income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence is about women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse just happens in domestic relationships -- <unk> and <unk> or said in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year for mates, <unk> and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to me at the subway in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had a <unk> from a <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most was that it was ready and fun, and it looked like a field.
He had a lot of big <unk> like apples and a <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of the <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and I loved everything from me, which was list, he had gone to Harvard, who I put a passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done.
And it was why the bachelor's of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was moving into a head at a physical trap financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where they were supposed to be so safe and bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma to a small day.
He needed them to feel secure.
But these <unk> were actually a message for me and, although I never came up with my hand, my life was already serious about danger, every minute in every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the <unk> suit of my mother and married with him.
Even though it had happened, I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved it, and he wanted me so much to me.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was simply very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and she <unk> me and he gave me so strong in the head that I would spend several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from the moon of milk was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac on the face.
<unk> went to <unk> one or two times a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to deal with the <unk>
The other question everyone else does is: Why is it simply not <unk>
Why don't I tell me, I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are us, because we are the victims, we know something that you usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of domestic violence in domestic violence occur after the victim to the victim after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent assault, even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and the family court system for <unk> the victim and their kids, who are usually forced by judges to spend time to spend time -- not <unk> with the man who owns their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to be able to go, and I was able to go out of one last fall, when she beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all the world to the police, to the police, to my neighbors and my family and family and full unknown, and I'm here today because you're all going to tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as headlines as <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The fault is by <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also assume that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that they would support their lives and happy lives and happily like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free lives of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor, of domestic domestic violence.
I became married with a cute and kind man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have never more, it's a <unk> gun pointing my head in the hands of someone who says they will.
At this moment, you're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have ever been talking about you.
I promise you there are a few people that are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put the end to my crazy love love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Violence abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their kids, their friends and family and family.
It will make the vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> that have a future future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop your climb and show the victims a safe output there.
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and make them feel that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I called Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed it like this.  Fortunately, I brought them clothes for you."
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> fewer than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to happen this sweater on the head, because it is when they go to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this photo.
The appearance is <unk> but also <unk>
I've completely changed what you thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and a photographer told me that I would take my back and get my hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which, even though shallow and shallow has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this scenario because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my work sector, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do me, but <unk>
The first question is, how does it be a role model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry and what we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been stuck with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> Joan Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know both of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told me all and every single role models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they weren't white people.
The next question that people will always make me is: Can you be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't get to that.
But then what I would tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon and a poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this one, she still <unk> No, no, no, Cameron -- I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> of the American magazine or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that's like saying that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's shocking, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model -- because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have to have your studies, and you have a bunch of jobs on your back, no matter what you think you want to be president of the United States -- but you think you want to be president of the United States, but your partner <unk> of clothing for 10 years, people would look strange at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it turns out virtually all the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're getting into the personal field, but it was a girl.
This is how I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and at the <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: Do you have for free?
I have too many <unk> heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he went on a red light and of course, and of course, we <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for power to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege that I think, is not why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance regardless of who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino them, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I get married, and <unk>
And when I looked at this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes down to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give you an answer that maybe maybe you will.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people.
And all that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day.
And if you ever ask, with a smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair and clothes more to the fashion but probably be the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of race and gender and gender and I'm one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that will retain this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was most enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to me who owns them.
There were no <unk> not <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum <unk> in lighting.
In fact, most of the shots at random.
My story starts in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
He just happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why not take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to get out of the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, nobody has slept with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change the life this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day was that day a five-year-old was going to understand.
These pictures are much more than a specific moment or a specific trip.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week of October and trying to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always get the same picture, the perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with the whole year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when suddenly they stopped in my dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the pirate store that <unk> from the previous <unk>
And it described me what had felt about the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered its heart <unk> with force at the first time nine years ago.
And now what you see in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I didn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the photo.
So today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I didn't see it in front of someone and asking me, let's get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the <unk> birds of <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and applause and these are the attributes that associate with the <unk> Parliament but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World Trade -- where we have 16 species -- these 16, 11 faced a high risk of extinction.
So, why are the <unk> are important -- first of all, provide green service services.
They're the <unk> of natural <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that will not be <unk> and caused great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are taken from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historical importance.
They've been associated with the old culture culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and maternity and with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture is being done very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood and wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at the end of the <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there is conflict between humans and <unk> The communities -- they use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, they <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey from livestock consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
So this drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- it has a huge time bomb to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the greatest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with the governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds, they cut it in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so you can focus on an underground problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with the governments in the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw it to fly without effort, and no energy cost in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
It was <unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we have to do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided we decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River and teach the local to grow tomatoes Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get --  We were amazed that the <unk> in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible to do that we didn't do -- we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  And I was going to have time to save the people of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never going to get it.
I thought that only for us would give mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, what they were doing, what the ones did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
Let's see the <unk> --  -- to see the waste that we gave them to <unk> people from Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was released in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent, two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> root that means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with anybody in a different culture like my sons, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face. The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put a pole on the ground and said, "We can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never happen to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the locals who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you do? Do you <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and it feels with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We joined in a cafe. We joined a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that the man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago and years ago, I had this idea, why not we get to a community to tell people what to do, why no, at one time, I would tell you, but not in your own meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they would never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what an opportunity have been identified.
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public <unk>
What do we do? We work on one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the doctor of the business, the family doctor of the business, which gets into your kitchen table, and that helps it help find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western science.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this condescending <unk> where we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do that? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before being engaged in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer you safe, privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then they will come out in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and <unk>
What do you talk about -- more this morning, more of this morning.
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that an entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution that are <unk> fossils -- <unk> and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a lovely story that in a <unk> journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year we were brought together this group of people together, and they had a lot of people who would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses -- it would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in the United States in 1900, in the United States appeared -- generic manufacturers.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few hundred factories in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
In other ways, they don't have to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you a serious absolute <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth with about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We looked at and looked at the 100 companies of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have common in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I would never have the word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in coffee bars in bars with their dedicated business in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> somebody who talks to you, what need it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't enjoy a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay to borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for cow stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and fix it.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> they give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a <unk> in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most abandoned amount of U.S.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected <unk>
I thought a lot about death and so on.
And it made me a very profound gratitude for the time and the time.
It provided the meaningful things of my life today.
But let's just have this look at my daily life.
I think it's easy to be able to be able to go through the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turn the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on it sentences for <unk> "Before they die from dying <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die from dying, I want to be on <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the <unk> line of <unk>
Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die from dying, I want to make it more and more."
Before I die, I want to go to the <unk>
Before I die from dying, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort at hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center -- we made a kit and now have been done in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, is more important than ever before, finding the ways of conserving the perspective and remembering that life is very quickly.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we were going to be used for death is one of those things that were more power.
And if you think about the death of our life.
Our spaces can share the better what it matters as individuals and as community and more media to share shared leaders, fears and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's very hot.
You don't speak, but it's transmitting joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It is <unk> it will happen to happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about the religious differences and look at this: It's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I didn't even believe -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it has to be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remind me if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we drove when I was four years old, I stood in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and Mr. Lady birthday <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the <unk> concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you didn't consider it within the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- that was <unk> people and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In every individual, it plays a different way, which is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or cure cure for it.
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was very much.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, watching the washing machine and eating anything that would have among them?
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were more obvious.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who looked at the world without <unk> a human being that had never been.
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, when I wish I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that would not want to change by normal.
The normal thing is about the beauty of the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could put it a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift in your inside and, honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a training of communications, which would give me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared --  -- the real <unk> of these students with their great minds with their great minds and their big unknown books and their great unknown words.
But when those conversations were, I felt what <unk> must have felt when she fell down the hole in the rabbit and saw the door in a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students with the students, and I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges from energy and health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists as a scientist as well as the <unk>
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please do with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't you tell us that you study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, caring for <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein said, which is all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are ways to hook it up and engage with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you asked why they're called <unk>  What do you do <unk> the bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's moving too much in the area of our brain and being <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> which is to be able to understand if you lose a little bit, and then to give it a graphs that will lead to our other senses, and make a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge without matter <unk> platform, and that, when he won, it gets by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the base of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said to the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He was thrown at the <unk> Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's literal thing.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that could have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it a <unk> state of the <unk> and others, <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there could be <unk>
Everybody got tired of the world tired because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want us to Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call it if he would give him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give you the more <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> than it happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. We didn't invent the title, but it just meant <unk> that was <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> from small <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a title as ridiculous and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk> --  -- you might keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the President of President of the United States does not sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to measure, the world's largest economy and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a spike then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy that has 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to be <unk> when you tell you that it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to give you a <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually fundamentally change the words more than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies <unk> in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about it, but most of all, this cacophony of male <unk> and stones and stones with tools that are primitive.
Like others, I have a cheap light of light -- I have a cheap light of light -- she holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole in that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, that lost control and fell in the <unk>
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in that hole in order to pay their lives without paid or reward and often dying.
And I went home, and I went home, but they may never do it because they are <unk>
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is dedicated to modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there in the world but not like grade.
When we finished talking to me, I was very <unk> I was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me kind of a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the CEO of the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of you actually considered it my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of displaced Africans throughout the entire slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
And the equivalent of about 50,000 people are today.
However, today, you can take entire families for generations per debts for 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues from over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then find that they are forced to work without the threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, the slavery operates in <unk> goods produced <unk> <unk> but those who produce them are dangerous.
The slavery exists in almost everyone and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and ridiculous show was like getting into the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, families in fact, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their head, and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work at silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no time to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> I was going to just pee out quite <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and let it work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was like, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry, but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly came to me and said to me, <unk> don't get it, don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizen of that country.
He could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he trusted that I read it.
When I was waiting to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found kids carrying stones for miles per miles per <unk> until trucks they were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than the children who charge them, and the kids would take them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
You have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this world consciousness, they warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously been <unk>
It led me a little bit of stairs that would give up this dirty basement of <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as being known in the craft, they are all the local for formal presence.
They have small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they are forced to be <unk> and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every single place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember there would be a sense of <unk> <unk> fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be caught in that hell.
He only had a <unk> the steps where they <unk>
There was no doors.
There were no big windows like it to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300 children are sold every year as sex use.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with the labor workforce.
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the <unk>
This is a family portrait,
The black hands of black are the father, the blue and the blue and the blue ones of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went through a quick look.
I saw what appeared that appeared to be a fishermen family, on a boat, two brothers, some younger kids, some of the younger kids, it makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work <unk> long in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was a little bit of topic that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
<unk> branches of trees submerged in Lake <unk> and they often trap networks and kids, and with fear, you fall into water to unlock the branches.
Many of the <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
As a fear of his love is not going to run and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at the age of five in the morning, when they went to the last networks, but they had been working since the last networks, but they had been working on.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village in fishermen.
I met it in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes what's possible.
Who's going to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He went through a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
It asked us to put it on a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would be able to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go very quickly.
Then it pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the road and after walking around an hour, we found that the way I was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in a course of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer camp, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs, and while looking for gold, they were looking for gold and <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because a lot of had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that will then be shipped to another area where they were shipped the gold to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to it, the margin is going to work at other lucky ones and children.
All of these are victims of disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> per few years ago.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
When they die their uncle, the <unk> the debt of the uncle is going to be a slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked on the <unk> 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that physicians were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work at night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and <unk> with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a higher possibility -- what inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we knew that we will be testimony to them and to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see us each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These are the images of people -- these are real people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these many beautiful people <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force when you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out to turn a fire and that fire will light up on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math, and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> is like management crap!
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to tell you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
You know, the <unk> of the heavens and the <unk> dancers  that we'll see later on.
But the demands for a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some of the initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's or Parkinson's disease gradually gradually this extraordinary ability, like what it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a ballet ballet dancer in his time.
In the last few years has been done a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools that we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress progress and ultimately the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, so they don't have biological markers, and the best thing we have is a neurological test of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they have never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do their exam <unk>
It wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars to the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a very conventional form of a try, you see, in some sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows somebody healthy while it emits sound as they speak, and we can think of it as dancers of a vocal laughter, because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs, to produce sound and all of the genes need the <unk> <unk> for example.
And as the complaint it takes a level of an extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal chords as they <unk> and like Parkinson's -- it affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurologic test is not <unk> they use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but the <unk> examinations are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something happens to be a cost. It comes up with mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to help address.
We can reduce our patient <unk>
I would not need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could do <unk> mass <unk> for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the very first time.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have domestic lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's disease, can call under the price and to leave it for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Right?
<unk> You can see, some people may not have <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors looking for the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a precision limit at this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic work and now has proven that works on the mobile phone network as well, what the project is, now we have an 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We made it in the dark, on the <unk> in the <unk> and we often avoid sunlight.
We do the thin <unk> still more <unk> the perfect skin -- the perfect skin -- we make the impossible -- it could be made in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photography.
On March 11 of 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happen in Japan.
A long time later, an organization where I was <unk> -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response equipment.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers -- we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> fishermen in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
<unk> water level took over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers on the inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud off, and we leave the homes to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we love it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photographs and chambers and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
We <unk> and take them to different places of the villages around the village for <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While he was out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk>
It helped clean the toilets, huge toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the <unk> center, the photos.
And there I had the honor and I had the honor that it was <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until moved through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl and I had to get a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the appearance of her itself, and that would be so tragic as you have the photo <unk>
With the passage of time, they always got the more pictures and it was needed more <unk> and it was more <unk> so it went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> a neighbor village north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporal libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time you get in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
He could get an hour. It could be a <unk>
It could be a <unk>
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand out of using as a guide to the areas whose color and detail is not destroyed.
It took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are <unk> covered with bacteria, with algae with algae -- with the algae -- with the algae that I continue with the time time I continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless I was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photographs anymore.
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped realizing that the <unk> even longer.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been <unk> we were able to put the images into a single photo and put it to the whole picture.
When I picked up their photos shared some of his history with us.
Some of her husband found the pictures on a fire station, between the rubble pretty far from where it used to be your house, but their colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their small kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and know that everybody was surviving.
The day I gave him his photos his child was under 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could do to look at, something that could remember the past day that would have been marked by the past day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- <unk> hundreds of them, helped us to clean up more than <unk> of <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the vast majority of most of them became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers from everybody around the world helped us back to 90 families -- completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than a thousand in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One photo is a picture of someone or something, one of the other, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would allow us, but the first thing that we would need to look for.
Over this was the project to restore the little pieces of mankind, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a photo like this gets back to someone, it doesn't make a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- to bring something bigger -- using your talent for something that are not going to be thin <unk>
I would like to read this email email -- I sent him Cindy the day that came back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a picture with women in different ages of the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a <unk> picture of my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, me and my newborn daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs, right?
Thank you. <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to look wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet that cuts through an apple in an exhibition in one billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion -- but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that can make videos on motion motion in motion.
And so we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into a <unk> second or so, in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of photons just a millimeter pack.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet of a common bullet as well.
If we take that bullet and this bit of photons and put it into this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --   -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a pack of photons that starts <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces it inside.
At the time, the waves are moving around the table and because of the <unk> of the top of the bottle, it looks at the bottle, after several boxes, which some of the <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we do that it would go back the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit at the film?
One day?
It would be a very boring film, a <unk> <unk>
And what about how to do with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that get rid of the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light <unk> <unk> is still bright. It is not <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographers, you know, if you take a photo at low exposure, it enters very little light.
But we're going to be going to a billion times faster than the simplest exhibition, so I just entered some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of time, and we recorded over and over again with a very dramatic <unk> we took those data together, and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those raw data in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, either.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would let him see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could just throw some light on the door. You know, you go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique names.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what about the point corresponds to which distance.
As a laser project a laser can be able to record a <unk> photo that, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is at the way around the curve, there.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or could we build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body by using <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite hard, so actually this is a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new modality modality to solve the problems of information in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can do.
And creating a new form of computational photograph with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves and look at the time between each one of those waves is just a few percent of a second.
But here's a funny thing too.
If we look at waves underneath the <unk> they're going to leave it from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, or Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events in the world are sometimes happening in the camera.
Let's take the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can afford life, and give you free freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a <unk> in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, it will move it to the song and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that you would go for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who in the exhibiting have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's very much. Almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This board says that every European company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of the users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to who.
Who's sent to a <unk> text.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or your Internet provider or your Internet.
And in all Europe people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone <unk> and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was <unk> journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people that came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some people even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret policeman of East ink.
And I also asked myself if this really works really.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't have a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, "We're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end, an agreement.
They took the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand people, 30 lines of information.
And I first saw it, and I said, well, it's an enormous sample.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it <unk>
Because I want to show people what <unk> <unk>
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> And we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go through the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call me each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communications network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with who, who's sent an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And, as a result, neither the fall of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as it could be inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to stand forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not quite <unk>
When you go home, you go to your representative of the representative because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store you know?
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that takes them to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi right! What happens?
Not enough.
Hi right! What happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
And I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> poor in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, that's why <unk> all the time.
look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> It can't be <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus from my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of us to know that any of you in the present way.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish you will be disabled.
Come on.
Chris <unk> are in the mall driving in search of parking search and what do you see?
16 places for disabled
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is only one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood, and my disease had the same initial principle.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters went to public school, my parents were <unk> to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out of the <unk> and if we didn't take all the top note of the top of it, we had my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used to do was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I got it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the childhood kindergarten I was walking like a boxer who has gotten many <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are now 20 Arabic, and they keep all of the family --  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like <unk>
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
But nevertheless, it seemed to be a lot of a hunger for hungry during the <unk>
I would tell you that it had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating three months without eat, so you get at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance.
I learned to <unk> with <unk> or that I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if I didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we get rid of <unk>
On the summer vacation of the summer, often my father tried to <unk> so I was drank from <unk> and I was drank with warm cups on the back, and I was standing on the <unk> Sea, and I remember that the water was going to get my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before we do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that couldn't stand up with <unk>
And now I can stand up in the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital Hospital.
I went to college with the positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> the pet department of the theater.
I was <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal of the crystal of my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with the cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with the cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four o'clock <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of all, <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why she and she told me that they could not make the usual <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and turned it to an actor without the cerebral palsy, <unk>
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated, I went back home, and my first tour tour was as an extra one in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors don't have <unk> "We were not white, with disabilities.
Just pay for perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, he took videos from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first sentence that took when he fell at the realization that he was going to go high speed on the highway of New Jersey with a driver who had cerebral palsy, <unk>
I worked in clubs all across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that tiny unpleasant sound that says women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and dad, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the means to remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program, by wire down with Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I was to a graduate dance, I was invited to a study and sat in a <unk> wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I introduced to the desk from the speaker to not go out of the screen on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I went down to the full time and hit my chair.
A fun thing I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The children are said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and no older ones.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips on line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"Is it <unk>
And my favorite man, <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We really should pray for her."
A reviewer suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
And the doctors were saying that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
But if I grew up with the media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I was <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I was acting in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children refugee refugees -- a little bit of what my parents told me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting alive, and I do this talk to your memory.
<unk> in <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a little boy in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and on the edge of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there is no job, no work out of the future.
He just lived in a tent, in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day you get a guy who gives him to take it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
I read a young guy.
He finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky -- a bomb.
That little boy in that little village with the great city dreams was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start your future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he took it out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It is the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, of well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to the <unk> will be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, they <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work at school.
They do pretty much nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember standing at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to get some leaders juveniles at a corporate basis?
<unk> to about 90 leaders juveniles <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, that because he was a college graduate university, it was the perfect whites for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to the point A to B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war, have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> tied to the local residents who they usually couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do is different?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate <unk> and I think the business spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are seeking so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business enterprise.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent from plastic from the abroad.
If you give somebody to someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers, <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would say, <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could they survive the hard climate <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where young families, the young people, can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not breed pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the background of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a great step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and put into their businesses.
They give the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to go from the conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park <unk> that's how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids on the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for it.
It gave them the opportunity to escape from <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn young people in the entrepreneurs, and eat their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and Parks from the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in upstate New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was made that the <unk> leaves like a <unk> and not being on the way that we were able to <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- metal balls, aluminum balls, and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought they would clean their <unk>
That question kept with me, and it was just a little.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the clean <unk> Department of trash, at 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of waste product every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their routes and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I started working like crap.
I didn't just travel on the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical mechanical mechanical and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you will be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get out of weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still going to get the weight of taking over their body tons of trash every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the garbage collection is one of the <unk> most dangerous ones in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and they're going down around you.
They just want to be <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that they often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about how relentless garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a <unk> and circulation.
It must always be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
I think that the stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficiently and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> their container and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
The disease that we had run for decades and centuries come back, and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have room for what the economy engines start to fail when it's endangered the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just bring your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
And with that, I mean simply at the speed when we used to move at the <unk>
We usually don't get rid of it, and we don't have to get with us our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We used them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that is taken from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe you will be able to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when it <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a kind of relief.
The flow that they keep us with except for ourselves of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, I went down to my son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank thank his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate waste collection and went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have a species to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The municipal waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose work is to clean the crap out of you, let's give it a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you much.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
So I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other one in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall for various floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy stuff.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the cladding with crystals -- it generates heat inside, so it's necessary for a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, it has nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this <unk> air structure where thousands of people -- they go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern modern building, from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the setting the site, which is located in a very much area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also among two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing that we did was to create a connection between these two streets, by <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this is spreading into a <unk> <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the open air in the building that would be made, and the rain rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be attached to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also from the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and it helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way that controlled the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not a commercial center.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the commercial center, because in order to bank there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was far more expensive, not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut down almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that we set up water for the <unk>
It's waiting for the early next year, because we go through the fifth floor floor.
The second example is a master plan from 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that big, the biggest thing that I have -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I got special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> that was surrounded by a certain wall with a dozen access doors connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets, creating 12 early blocks in size, and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick some points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell cell cell, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's make a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to the local norms that set up a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space occupied space.
It's where all the neighbors, you can upload and <unk> and make activities like running a race to two kilometers per morning, or to jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that grow buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but we need to make sure that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect the nature with the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was super strong for the state capitals very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister <unk>
One day I was given a time after the school, was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took on the table of my master's book <unk>
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of a few Like this.
All of the likes --  And I was set to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I went to all rows of <unk> and I was just a row of that, just by being there, because I am."
I'm still amazed by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt so good.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was that everything was an obvious one.
I would never get stuck.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I was bothered by this little girl that was so small, it was so good for <unk>
Would the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
But the birds are also very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which the <unk> are in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no rate, there would be no literature.
I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
There is no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without germs, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and, in terms of the bathtub it almost has all of them.
This year they have been 100 years of their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the most enjoyable study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details that are <unk> right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard this image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books which Virginia said was as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious like the future's going to be reduced to person, to your desire, to their <unk> are a narrative basis of <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel better, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being in the time, and audience, we know exactly what <unk> <unk> to <unk> the knife -- right?
The <unk> are made to all novelists <unk> and that's something I knew understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that the story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh <unk> that <unk> detects in his lover and it adds up to her <unk> collection of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion of <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> you like the big amounts of hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the photos.
So Instagram is why Instagram is so successful.  <unk> links well in the language of jealousy.
So when <unk> is in his 16th percent of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these are the pathways toward the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need -- that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can tell us <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to tell us that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us with our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was consumed with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud says that there was something bizarre about that man, which doesn't get into what his wife was doing.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing <unk>
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> are very well described how <unk> they make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we became the <unk> of our fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself in the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman at Michigan of 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account at Facebook from the one that would be sent by <unk> terrible messages to themselves, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his ex-steel birthday, I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge even though we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> books that are trying to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the metro kingdom -- the membrane that separates what might be, it can be <unk> in an instant.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take away from your being and <unk> from what you once <unk> and it's under the floor -- you have to get your rings, takes your rings, your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when you're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the Oscar <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had to say, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers it.
Oh, my <unk> <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it turns out to be <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> it comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't like to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
At the next minute they're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to go from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So while we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Just fiction -- the jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look what they <unk> the sweet thing: the terrifying one, Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of July Buzz Aldrin went out of the <unk> on the Apollo <unk> of Apollo 11 and went on over the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were <unk> they were alone, but their presence in the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the majority of peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration with 20,000 companies, and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of the surface, which <unk> after the death of <unk> the last year is now the most <unk>
So why is it <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice in <unk> gives us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why does it work?"
So why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why will it climb the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why would you fly on the <unk>
Why is he playing Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're easy -- but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of successes technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and they eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what he Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
Over the most part of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with a sailing ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew crew of the Apollo 10, and the rare optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that we have the technology to solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission to me, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that has occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists had found us <unk> and they had enriched them with trivial toys, things like <unk> app and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale of <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley, which is that they have created less ambitious companies than <unk> for the years that you are <unk> you know, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists give the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused by the creation of ideas that are driven by the funding of <unk> or even <unk> problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk venture capitalists were at its high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred little investment, the minute they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and developing capital that they need a huge amount of capital and developing technologies have never invested in developing technologies intended to solve large problems, because they don't have any domestic online value.
No, the reasons why we cannot solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that would be popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things that do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar -- wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want more energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, the technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of a foreign energy increase a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an American energy policy or international treated that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of failure in the workforce.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food systems, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant guys to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need and should, but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a problem that we have to, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it is true with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition, like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no matter of science science -- like about exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that have been about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline in trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of the <unk> why people think that trust has been <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me think that there may be gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn into opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion surveys over time, there is no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were really reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> including nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the road.
But this is the evidence that enough?
What opinion surveys are, of course, opinion.
What else can you say?
What you see is the attitudes that people are <unk> when people are doing some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk> teachers.
I probably would have to ask by asking, "What does what?"
And that would be a very exciting response.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some, but in other cases.
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put the confidence in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a particular kind of <unk> official or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I have to say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my youngest friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why do we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust the more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to quantify the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I wish to have more confidence in what is <unk> trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were buying their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment about how serious people are in particular ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible and honest -- then we will have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest that are <unk> but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that we would have their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are restricted and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If this is still not <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> <unk> before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we tried to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the original <unk> that I want to go into child itself.
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we will argue that the <unk> system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You know, you have the things that you are familiar with similar examples.
So let's put all that, for the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we think about being worthy of trust, and we will tell the people that we are safe and if we stop determining whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action, the <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to reconstruct trust, puts the things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if you're two people, together, trying to improve the confidence.
But trust, ultimately is <unk> because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You've got to give you the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't fix it, because of all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to give us a <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do we do that?
That makes every day, everywhere, makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> it without giving explanations away.
I carry them and turn it back to me for the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have a confidence that you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're looking at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
So since the early computers have come to be <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, at the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
So I started imagining how it <unk>
It first created this tool that gets into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the <unk> screen is the physical body to the pixel up.
The designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the booms.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk> area.
And we put a transparent bombsight with a transparent bombsight with depth of the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, reach into the inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and <unk> <unk> or words with the virtual touching sensor that's down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
So in these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we do that digital data comes towards us?
And so many of us would have bought a lot of us will be bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in the space, how can we make them physical and so we can be able to be physical and <unk>
How would a future be?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, that we created this only physical pixel in it.
This magnet, <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and controlling the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to digitally program the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay for all the physical world.
You can teach it physically and be able to be able to physically be and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can reproduce it as a physical reality the times we want it.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbook or text, this is a real experience and palpable experience you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, the digital data is not just going to show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only edge is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was embarrassed to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to invite a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a difficult path to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera, Chinese opera.
This was me at my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and a radio show.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at 15 years, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I recognized that for the rest of my life a second class of second was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I was in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about the Chinese <unk>
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told you, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And the meeting with a new culture has also given me to my breathing habit.
And so many perspectives.
For example, in the beginning, this map seemed to me because this is what students in China learn it.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative literature and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers the academic a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked worked for research, why don't you do it as well as life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual development.
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> path of the <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of getting lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, this is through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to get back or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness.
To a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy -- living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered he threw on the couch in my office and took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I was so <unk>
My fellow class had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to just move your head while they <unk> the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, they got home later, he has children later, the death goes later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to stop.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex I would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No no, but maybe it <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they <unk> but this didn't do that the <unk> of Alex were a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think nobody gets to age without spending before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! You're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay. It <unk> the real <unk> matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of the 10 choices and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life have happened to have 30 and <unk>
People from the more of 40, I didn't go <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or come out with their future children at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second stage and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it was <unk> for the <unk> what it means that if there is something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any moment of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top to the top of the 28 and the things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> about their body and options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial in language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment when their everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence for the <unk>
<unk> were <unk> names, names of <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give you a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then all the days, smart smart, interesting intelligent, you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't own. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better on the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, he crashed the music and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stand at a stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Not do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to the 30 and so many of the starting one career, to choose a city, and have two or three children in a very short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle class crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> realize that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I <unk> What was I <unk>
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At the 25, she came to my office because he was in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she would wake up her back to say, "You don't choose their family, but he can pick their friends."
Well, a day she got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and he had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many good ones, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words "In case by emergency words, please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give up <unk>
At that time, I was a lot of job to resist to work and not say, <unk>
Which Emma needed it was not a <unk> that actually was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1960s.
So for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that was <unk> from this identity of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> of that company that you want to do it.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not count, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and do it count.
Secondly, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds that are just limited to who you know, how you think about how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was going to leave almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak bonds of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak bonds are the way we get to this group.
The half of the jobs we ever have to have never been able to know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job of a <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least important, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma would soon return to his family when they have a couple, and it forms his own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or tell you when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill for anyone else who you get them to you.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in a children's museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special <unk>
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new career, and I would send a letter to me that said, "Now the emergency space spaces are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who go out to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, the 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I'm privileged now to say to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> get their <unk> to use their weak ties to pick your family out.
Don't you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics at seventh grade students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I gave you tasks.
When work came back, <unk> grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in <unk> in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for the time enough.
And after several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure more ways.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of crazy scenarios. And in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who they <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in the very difficult neighborhoods, and what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective person in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking what of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it has a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see the <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> tests even security that felt the children were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little bit that we know how little the science knows about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I resolve children in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid <unk>
How do I keep it driven for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related or it's even related to the measures of talent.
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and the belief that the ability to learn is not true that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow into the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is permanent condition.
So the mindset growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, and we have to be willing to fail, to begin to start all over new <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
It was in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems like the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every one of the drawings of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than doing it in a faster and simple way.
Chinese Mandarin <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic science.
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read automatic traffic signals from <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who goes to a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like I was shouting at <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol actually is <unk> in the form of calls it but I like to believe it is in the other way. The one that it works.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates in the old <unk>
I call this eight characters.
They are building blocks so they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, two are a crowd.
If a person rolling his arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a poetry like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the ground.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- to remember, because a speaker tree, it's quite an idiot.
Remember <unk>
Two things together, it gets very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door, you put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth on the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming hidden out of the door, you know, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese Chinese.
So after the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun in the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> are <unk> to their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has turned to date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be <unk> is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Oz of Oz together.
And the movie has taken their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand, and I had a magic wand, and he took a magic wand, and he had a magic wand, and he had a magic wand, and he had a magic wand, and he had a magic wand, and he had a magic wand, and he had a magic wand, and he had a magic wand,
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex game show.
However, the Oz of Oz was an event event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl in dresses as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there is a couple of big differences between the <unk> <unk> and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the Oz of Oz would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a prophecy.
<unk> secret shoes to defeat the armies made by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the one of the Oz is that the most wise and wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years.
He was not invited to the projection, because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level had <unk>  And so slid it in the room and was impressed in the room and she was impressed as a mother in his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but I would have <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, resilience and <unk>
I would have a feeling that Luke is one to a military for overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> Oz of <unk>
How does Dorothy your film?
I do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with it, and not a world of men that are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force and capital of the movies for our kids, and so little on the way of <unk> brick path.
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> does not give me the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first sentence, I really expect the credit to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on <unk> <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There's a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney of the Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, guys, are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend ourselves from <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our kids, so real and lovely things like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being war films.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues to appear in classic in classical times, every one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who breed a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critic said when he came out there.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is happening for <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of mine about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be, in the movie, there are more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
Their conversations are about something more besides the guy than you like it?   All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of quality, <unk>
Right?
<unk> doesn't happen to the <unk> test.
And I don't think they <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen the movie -- a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door, and say, "Come on to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's turn it into the numbers.
In 2011, in the most popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we have recently chosen for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what it was.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the <unk> of mass entertainment.
I don't believe that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics -- one of the things that I think is that there's a huge amount of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to make it out.
We have tools like we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly to parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is changing radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character was from "Star <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories when I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where you see that his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I was more like was to look for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that it would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was overwhelmed with <unk>
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up at one of almost 1,300 miles away from length to the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we see the <unk>
This is a located place in the eastern East <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an ancient city -- called the <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Forest about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of the ancient <unk> art and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located in some place near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it went to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And I will try to find out that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle change.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation, we look for human occupation to us.
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years to date out the Middle River exactly the same period we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry, the Middle Ages, these are the stones that <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation, which goes from the 20th century in this place.
We also have evidence of a shoe shop which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's put it into a near future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also do great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the 20th century, probably it was written in <unk> four years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the greatest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to the TED is not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
And the ideas were actually started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the <unk> for sea <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the front door, in front of the <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now we have a bunch of obese people on the bikes, bicycles.
You're competing with a racing career <unk> and they go back to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide up against the door of their home.
There is <unk> flying everywhere, which goes on the side of the wheels that they end up in place, the rays of the wheels that you end up in the side of the door, and you get the threshold of the door.
To the <unk> or what there's on the other side of the door, and you see the quality of the door, and the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel his blue <unk> turning on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you're going to pass it into the mouth.
They went around and enter their living room.
Whether in the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
She's with little clothes, dancing on his center, singing <unk> singing <unk> One More <unk>
Now we go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> path from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Wizard of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, I guess, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different kinds of ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, just look at them once.
They <unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
We took whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be a phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and have one of the best <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition they say they have normal memory.
"We trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques -- invented a thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used to <unk> to memorize their <unk> and the <unk> academics were used to memorize children's books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I hear from this <unk>
And we were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful man, and brilliant -- although a little bit <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of cards -- live on national T.V.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
Or you have to start for something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange trip to me.
And I ended up spending the most part of the year -- not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow us to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on the back, I read a number of treaties on the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it might be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to supply their minds.
These techniques have made it possible for our modern world, but they have changed.
We have changed and <unk> and I would argue that they've changed any cognitive development.
As we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where it's still passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory memory and <unk> is this kind of unique memory competition.
It's actually not so <unk> there is a skills like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're just more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a form of cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There were certainly a really interesting difference and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them in a magnetic MRI machine, and they put your brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> out of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive drive is running like a armed race in which every year has someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On your desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> that he's about trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits -- <unk>
In a half hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways that we can remember things in these content, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
This is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox of <unk> <unk> he says this: I tell two people to remember the same word. I tell you to you -- there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you know there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So let's see what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is little likely to remember the same word that the person who said their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance in their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have flour in your hands.
They were okay when they go home to work.
You probably would have some <unk>
And when we put that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it was not brought to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on my feet, and he said, <unk> his memory poem, and it was <unk> and as soon as it was, the hall of the <unk> is <unk>
They are all going to be <unk>
But it was not only killed all of us, but it shattered the bodies that were <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
And so they could not be <unk> the <unk>
And one tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I was sitting next to each other.
I took the family of the <unk> hand, where they were their loved ones between rubble.
What we have to have <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or numbers of telephone or instructions or instructions for the word of colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional memory.
If I told you that I was <unk> the first 10 words in the history I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the brown horse in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first set of memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from the same way that he would have done it if they had done it if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of their home.
And some kind of an image is absolutely <unk> crazy and crazy to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and seeing the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then it turns into the kitchen, and the fourth thing they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help remember it.
This is how speakers are <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for word -- that is going to confuse it as typical as a typical <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> it would be like the first place in his 21st of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I was stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a long thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else is <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in the place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, I was sitting out of the morning before sitting at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was kind of fun.
I would never expect it to be <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just training memory.
What it's really trying to do is make more and more of the ability to create and imagine these images of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my training set of training for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety covers with tape with only tape -- because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that there was a year before, and I had the idea that I could put it in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's cute power to memorize speeches and phone phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the memory of the memory or memorize them from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory like it was about a gift -- but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention to.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We put a kind of deep processing -- a kind of a total processing that most of them are not going to stand up in there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even have to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so we just got a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from the <unk> Jersey, I had six years old, and I lived there at home in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony I gave in the living room.
And there everybody spent the time watching television and every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at me, and every time I stood up, and I was going back in a towel, all I saw me.
And I was like this.
It was cheaper, and I hated it.
<unk> that journey hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because the architecture is not about mathematics, or division of physical connections, but of those emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency in --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about -- you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it so by being built in a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very helpful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who have the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found it with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> who ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round thing, and columns, it is red, that they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> kids, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the forms of life today.
We <unk> we gave ourselves and we gave ourselves a lot of the people.
All of the black, this is coming, you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to those <unk> symbols here.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started to start experimenting with the pendulum back forward, over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago about the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
Let's get the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
And we added neon and we added the bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made it into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The forms were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those erotic fantasies could be <unk> to French.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can visualize memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know that this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now have new design techniques with a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum matched, in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> and public and public and general public, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous in the world around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and so quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had a culture and they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the early Millennium Development went with other star architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the end of the new millennium, actually started to go through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have to have to have been walking to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't really look for a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings -- before I know what I designed four years ago, was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
And for 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to happen. It's because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, and to be in both extremes -- almost in <unk> and it becomes effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the audience.
Now we can make symbols with almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that is <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked like exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a half of media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when they load these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians from <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experimentation with innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there are no unique response to what might be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using <unk> and complicated, and you're not a <unk> audience that doesn't support something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the former city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of <unk> <unk> <unk> in ideas that should be a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve to make sports or to <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> East <unk> in New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the community that made around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that go to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot on play.
The buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give them a way to the more <unk> the local libraries the local libraries and the homes where we are in our children, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that very cool way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you most like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And when I stopped doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people search on Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is ugly.
What his mom says and what his friends, or your friends, or <unk> they don't know who they believe.
So a video of her himself, publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others that please stop a <unk> "I'm pretty a nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 3,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and regular teenager, that gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable life of their life most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're low pressure of being online and available all the time, talking about, giving it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We have never been so connected in a continuous way, very young <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his room in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, it's always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide between a life in line and real life.
It's really difficult to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk>
What is the most dramatic thing in someone else's life, what is normal in a context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk>
<unk> <unk> still <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who do it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the sports stars and the folk singers in it.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort, to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like your relationships, the development of their physical capacities and their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls rather than they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and as taxpayers and the labor of working development.
31 percent, almost one out of every three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One out of five are not attending to at all in the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look good, specifically if you don't think you're good enough, you get a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about what looks like this.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be very clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you -- not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-worth is less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they engage in more diet not healthy that they can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think this is why they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drug consumption and drugs, diets aesthetic, aesthetic relationships to early ages and protection and harm and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first one is that we need to instill in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to develop strategies for the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs, without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that is still our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, and the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are <unk> <unk> for anyone who would be willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and let's be a better model to keep the women and girls in our own lives.
<unk> the status of the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as you see.
All of us can start by doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as a government and like governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing their children to be valuing their <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
It will make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that go out in the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe they see you see the ones that are the people who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are in your head?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is about two seats. What would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, he would get him out of having long legs -- more <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and we would call it the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are attached to us.
But let's get to our children the truth.
They assume the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for who they are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It took the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change every one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we put together together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age today, they will become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
<unk> initially was an innocent thing, but it was a prisoner in other minor charges in the company of others, they started planning attacks about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. <unk>
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, was unable to escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of his involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, with a loving mother by a <unk> <unk> teacher by the two made it all possible for giving me a happy childhood, a happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of the people that are <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use all the potential possible for everyone to live like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends he and a few friends, had been going back to training at Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> I threw <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot was given to the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise me, especially mine, all the goal was still on flames.
My uncle became the other and Arabic, like, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, I had a son.
And all of all, the comment made a lot of years later, but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later later would be committed to put them with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, and that instability in my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class they often was <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the silent class, silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time was going home to reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not develop social skills, to put it <unk> for growing <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I mean, I love to judge people, based on indicators and <unk> like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put a test for my thinking, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the youth of juvenile violence, as I had been victim to <unk> almost all my life, was something that I was feeling a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish age.
And I took several days to go out to the light this detail, and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By any chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed an empathy sense toward the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to talk to people, exactly the way I wish I would be <unk>
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be <unk> but I know what is being tested for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me honest with my <unk> and I was helping me to see that race of people -- religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was thinking, and she told me something that I will keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has had enough <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy needs to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope that someone, someone else is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was invited to this bird and violent ideology I didn't have to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved pain and the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has caused them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against these meaningless acts, like rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I show up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that's projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D and has sound sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> tastes and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments you project in front of your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you know, you and you.
There is nothing to be more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not mindful of us, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films.
Why are we not just the robots that we have to do for producing outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness in science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it is impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective it's objective to it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we will get that vision.
The psychology was studying the <unk> behavior, the neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started very few works on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real blowout, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of great work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of watching faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations today.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience shows some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to <unk> the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
It doesn't address the true central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do they operate the <unk> how they work, how they behave and <unk> the living organisms, all of them are questions about how the goal works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about how we talk about, how we have to play <unk> they are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior is between the easy problems.
But the difficult problem -- the question of why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here is the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually, it doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works for a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we would get rid of this point.
We have a lot of wonderful explanations -- great. We got used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology, the biology of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before being able to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem with consciousness.
The whole idea of the real subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the brain of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denial that the observation of consciousness is important.
But I'm in a different direction.
At the time you have -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of the most basic terms.
On the contrary, it's considered principles, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of <unk> time, time, mass laws -- so I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and he <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws of <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, weather, load, then by the matter of logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural would be <unk> the same as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is that what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, space, time, the mass, the <unk>
The physicists sometimes say that we want more fundamental laws so simple that we can get them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very fundamental laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what law is.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every single system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the flies, the flies, even the microbes from Rob <unk> even the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think "Oh, always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of feeling crude to <unk> some very primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is critical.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, and it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that maybe the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we thought with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Because there is information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
And a very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> made this kind of theory and developed it with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And what you're supposed to do is have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a similar degree of information integration -- quite significant, degree of consciousness, quite important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers are often observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality behind it.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that you put the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have some serious social consequences and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of starve.
I think it tends to make you know, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical and moral terms, not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of <unk> information, she has an integrated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they do these very serious ethical problems about the ethics of developing computer systems and intelligent computer systems and <unk> ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective consciousness the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk. At this point, we have a TED consciousness, an inner movie for this whole bunch of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you should be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer in the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing that is a fundamental thing that is universal.
<unk> raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way toward a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it from night to the morning.
But I think we finally will be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the true key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village on Victoria.
He had a very normal, an profile of education.
I went to school, I was excited about my friends, I was my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community reward.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She has never gotten nothing."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a little profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered if we take the disability out of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the 11th class of studies -- a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, "What do you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a few good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't know -- and it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this scenario -- I'm going to tell you what I do in this wheelchair and you probably are waiting for you to give them <unk> Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were interested in relationship to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and makes you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before the <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the child without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with blood fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term porn term <unk> because we would give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, let's give the disability to the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been approached by passionate about, expressing that you believe that I am brave or an inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remembering my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are given to the people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
You're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's have some things.
But the things that we expect are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I helped myself with the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disability because of society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
I need things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They are simply using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It is because of the lying, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it's not.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not going to be inspired by doing anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability right now.
However, I didn't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall across --  -- the clever trick of how to load your cell phone battery into your cell phone battery.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us life hard.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stairs hasn't done it never becomes a <unk>
Never.   So to a television screen, I'm not going to be able to appear for people to <unk>
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of nothing for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> by getting up with the bed and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the true achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a kid at 11 degree in a school school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a user <unk>
disability doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you believe to know what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is <unk> reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just will just answer one of those questions, so please don't be <unk>
When people think they really think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because the augmented reality to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to <unk>
The first step, is what I carry on -- the Google Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to do it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is run by the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
So we can know that a man is about 110 pounds of us trying to get it out of all their being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So let's put some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not a picture of the practice of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technologies is an underwater going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment. I get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football camp, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> Mice <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, IBM's <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "We can see from the angle of a field <unk>
I heard a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely most of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why for this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before and making a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of mine.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball into the bottom of the network? Or you're going to get a stick in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality. It is <unk>
How do we get to the reality <unk> <unk>
It <unk> the augmented reality of the <unk> and the <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. They give you money.
So, here's a quick refresher on the technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> so that it would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be able to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radii in the <unk> of the <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was more quickly, more entertaining.
In <unk> you can imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or because the strategy.
They just go out into the countryside and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they are <unk>
If you lose playing games with you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your form of playing the game.
So what would you do here?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know that.
The bad will have information <unk>
This is <unk> to good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being only for women?
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
What would it be <unk>
Imagine that you are the field.
<unk> the ball and <unk>
It comes into an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to kill you -- they don't know it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
It took the protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's an open receptor there.
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where it lands, but the receptor sees it in its bombsight in an area of grass that lights and you can modify the career.
You <unk> catching the <unk> run and run it.
The public <unk> and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
Let me do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
Do you want to be his favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, is we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just like bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It makes billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology to a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to be thinking more about space and science rather than <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality.
The questions that we do and the challenges we take and the challenges that we face, as well as all of us.
Thank you.
I recently struck me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, the southern end of the South County -- that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, the chief manager of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to <unk> test.
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from the openness, over 1600 people have jumped their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that the fall from it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one drop of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is breaking bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them dies in impact.
The ones who don't normally get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this method of suicide is realizing the death that they <unk>
This is the string.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel into the bridge.
This is where most people are before they got their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the more dark time, it's very hard to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with the joy that we had that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have formal training.
It was <unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This wasn't just a bad service to those that <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officials and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met it the 22 of Jules last year when they got a call of a suicide bomber sitting on the umbilical near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking with a officer.
Jason had only 32 years and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to eat suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> don't open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
She stopped some <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy, and the New Jersey and New Jersey had just taken the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason have <unk>
<unk> damage suicide is affecting a lot of people.
And I ask these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved being <unk>
What do you think?
What does it say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understanding.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they didn't get it.
You're just there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask the question is, let's see it in similar circumstances have thought to finish their life, you've had these <unk>
They went to the person in front of the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never going to happen to them, but they will never be able to be able to do the <unk> social isolation, and a missing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permit and blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED Conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty much, but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
He never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and it was <unk> as disappeared as that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the Mike car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> without having a real mental disease.
It must not be so easy to finish it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible suicide bomber on the sidewalk near the bridge north.
I put my breathe on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> of foot on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she turns out immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and the next half hour, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided to come back to that lane and give it the other opportunity.
When Kevin came back, they did it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did that <unk> and gave him the hope and the other life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother and Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing to erase the events in the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It has been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but because of God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as the <unk>
We give God for yourself.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writing, <unk> When I went at General Hospital in San Francisco at the night -- you know, like the patient.
I think I had it to be <unk>
Today, Kevin is an active father and an active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that his history to inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather had a poison.
That act, even though it will end up with your own pain, by stealing the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide does.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drug drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was overwhelmed by hand three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one they leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every one of us and every one of us must be working for doing.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't know, but in your inner side, you know what you are, and a question will you tell you, how do you get you in that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in the way I'm alone.
When I became a model -- I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my real truth, with my inside.
For complicated reasons, I will go back later, when I look at this picture, I got it, you got it <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all get our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin color or for the beliefs of the <unk>
They are people who always defy the status quo, what is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent even was ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
He recorded me like <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always putting this shirt on my head.
And my mom was going, "Why always you have that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because my success, I never get to share my story, not because it thought that I am bad, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family that just accept me like I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a feast in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something like me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a beauty beauty pageant.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was over the <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he was third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was from queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mother who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my statement from the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you fall in the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put two <unk> to my name.
She also sat down when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most rural cities in Thailand to perform the most <unk> sophisticated surgery.
At that time in the U.S., it was needed to be done surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> he lived his truth, but he <unk> he made his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we do a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I am on this scenario because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood up before injustice.
These are anything, P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and only for me.
I want to do the best to help the other to live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that there is no longer more than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
They'll you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  You know, thank you a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So first, thank you with all my <unk>
My support network to my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, and I would take the phone, he called my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just identity of gender, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table the theme that sometimes that was not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to say, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a space for curiosity to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. All right. <unk> Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, the parents are generally known for their kids, but I'm one of the very few parents who meet her for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts went into 2011, the <unk> National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you put a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the very beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, nor for his father, not by his mother.
On the neighborhood, he comes back to the mother and no one of the father.
And a mother was getting a lot to get a little bit of a child.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the daughter was newborn when it grows, it suffers from.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you stay home and the school admits of his siblings.
Until the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
It can be <unk>
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move across the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into the early adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you're a sandwich to get out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if I <unk> the code of that of the course honor, it could even kill them.
And it's interesting that this idea code is not just affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more standard rule that is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and they support the choices of their father and her mother and women's decisions even if you will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you read it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If you have a very young, she has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I was incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was thinking, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I took my pen, and I took a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years old and <unk>
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?"
Yes, I must be <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of their identity and his name.
One to the school means that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian form, and I was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go with me with different meetings.
And all of these values, I have tried <unk> in their personality.
And it wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've been asking all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education to <unk>
My daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
It was <unk> and sisters, and sisters, and more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and, in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all the political and economic activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
Musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers would die.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up and raised out the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he offered her same for the New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine at October 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love him to my wife and "I've got <unk> so I spent my daughter, your <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please don't bother you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These were very few words very much for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to make me good. Please do not move.
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and we've learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights, and of women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when you didn't have his task.
You fight with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is a special thing in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave expressive and <unk>
I mean, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I am engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group -- where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before we join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you fall into a brain operation.
You're still the same as intelligent or not?
It's not going to be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take over a dozen different chemicals every day, because if he didn't take anything, she would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix out chemicals, and try and keep it to keep life.
More than I have saved me.
But luckily, I got a soul to <unk> so I decided to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with a different mix <unk> and I was shocked to see how little changes in the dose of drastically drastically my <unk> my sense of who I was like, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly exciting case for a few months, I tried a dose dose and a typical <unk> for an early man, and I was shocked to see how I would <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person in the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known a number of guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that had on the front, and it just wasn't going on.
So I couldn't afford it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about the men and what they have to do is that I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my thought to creative, my <unk>
So we would think almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key reference, how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
So today you have to challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works -- to me, it's simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> pretty sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination just to run the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in the neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image MRI and functional MRI to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
And the column in the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the middle of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual <unk>
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
Then, they showed them a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as long as it was <unk> a new <unk>
So the computer -- using only the brain information scanning the scan to show you what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're pretty close to doing that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it is created in the brain the same <unk>
It took place with the <unk> brain scanning systems, available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give myself for that.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques beyond images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of MRI -- first we have to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets but at this point, magnets more <unk> only give small improvements at the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than magnets larger, make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and bright in coding and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> often in MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field in a magnetic field, the magnetic patterns <unk> the frequencies of radio <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing processing patterns we can increase in massive <unk> the information that you can get into one <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid, but the <unk> of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity is sleep.
We will be able to push our ideas to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thought skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have little options that open this door.
Anyway, they choose one year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll tell you this night about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay self.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe it's to tell you some person for the first time that love or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you can put through in life.
Everything else is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and got out of that closet is universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked on the South Side Side years ago, and I was there, and I had to go through various phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope with the <unk> of my short <unk> and I had my head <unk> my head was made a little bit of a little boy -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would have a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit longer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father says, <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not tell you anything, and it was <unk> inside.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
So that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared -- and I was about to enter the female issues at the table --  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" that we <unk>
And so I took it deep down and I went down and went down and my back a little four year-old girl with a pink dress looking at me, which is not a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you a kid or <unk>
So I took a long time to take it up, and I started <unk> about it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is really confusing, right?
I have the short hair like the guy in a boy, and I saw a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to wear a rose dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable bedroom.
Now, I'm more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me and looked at me, and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was the whole thing. You're just getting a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the difficult difficult conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, the walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color they are the walls.
You just know how it feels like it feels like a closet.
It's like my closet is not different than yours or yours or to yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why to get out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell you to explain to someone who have declared on banking <unk> it's harder to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than telling you to say to your five-year-old <unk>
There is no more difficult, it is only the hard.
We need to stop classify what is hard to deal with how hard for other people to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live in something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, which had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
I was not the smart lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years that would get to coffee.
I was frozen in the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark grenade <unk> my grenade <unk> and the moving just a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my full strangers with the I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people knew that it was gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents' friends, people I knew I was doing years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace Will <unk>
And you know who we have to take care of.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but rather trying to show his support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing a <unk> shirt.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the real thing that we <unk>
It's like the hard conversations remain without my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones I <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what is going to be out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know that we do suffer.
Number two: Be the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You would never get rid of that.
And some of you may be injured safe, they will be injured by what they have done, but they never feel what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that kind of thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark closet -- <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And it may feel like they feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence, you have seen intelligence, a very productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is so interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer scientists like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we took a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that they're from an alien race of the earth that you know nothing about the biology of the Earth or the Earth intelligence or the Earth intelligence -- but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, which does not have any concept about the Earth of the Earth, you would see that to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until some time in time, the asteroids that we have to put on the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took done several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finely finely honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we <unk> the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the creation of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues, and we put together all these different issues, and we set up together, I said, <unk> -- there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, C, which acts in the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open options, with the diversity of potential accessible, and yes, to an imminent future time to maximize it.
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open-ended options.
And so in account of this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life they should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection to the entropy and the intelligence has a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not just correlated with the long-term entropy production -- but it actually starts directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long term in any system that you find inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal tests, play games, and even make money out of human intelligence, and they can even make money out of it, and they would have been able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human, here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for robotics <unk> and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, the same as some other animals can cooperate throwing off the ends of the opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against themselves, providing their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> getting new connections into a social network where their friends are constantly constantly moving and keeps success the very connected network.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> we organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using Panama Canal to scale up the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable into defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> will spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated field of actions, successfully by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the work -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, in the beginning.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion, <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's the contrary, the urge to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that the overall intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, rather than being upside down.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the goal.
I'm often asking me, how do you look for goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, it has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which is what the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the intensity that measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they put into a little bit of the light that will get us.
The data gathered in Kepler -- show the sizes, of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their parent star.
In together, this helps us to understand if these planets are little and <unk> like the planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their mind.
At their time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure trove of worlds that are potentially defined our own planet is getting under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from the millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say, I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor's Mars.
Mars is little and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface in search of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission is taking samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> to remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the equatorial areas of our planet that still stay in the <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places on Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will take a great and sad deal, the implication and the belief that some of us that Mars would expect that to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly true, the Earth.
For a lot of the way I like the exploration, I am in deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will be a place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the earth is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and global spaces of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked myself, having in account that our universe has existed for a long time ago, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that are going on.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> and the <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to make the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went back to my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table where he had <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all right.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and my <unk> and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at the end of the night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, the very long room is.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate increase, and you will move your thinking.
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do -- systems that could put in his place, which would be bad things going on.
Or at least if things happen, bad things, you know, the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe does.
So I started thinking about it, but until a month later, my thinking didn't happen.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> won the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked to him that broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called something called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then it tries to figure out what can do to prevent things going on, or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, you have a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to keep tracking the location of the important things, where the ones are, where the fish are, where the trees are, where the trees are living in, where women are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that enables the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut <unk> sense of the <unk> and they could still find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, <unk> and <unk>
So at home, you have a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular crate for your passport.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and are <unk> with it your stuff always going to be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a photo of your cell cards, your credit card license, your <unk> passport, your way to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases this?"
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that the stress will not be at the best time, and you need to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care, or the one to be, to help them make a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all making of medical choices, and made for the decision-making of financial decisions and making social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take away from the fact that they would benefit from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and cholesterol is a little <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of <unk> diseases attack the heart injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> medicines in the world today, even it's likely to know people that <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most physicians who don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which believe it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This as the research of the researchers at the cynical researchers and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, heart spill or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the prescription for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is to ask for a more statistic of the <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things -- some muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, in stress they don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people are taking the drug, right? A person has taken over five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out with the drug that you can help you help you.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say they have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethics does is part of the informed consent principle.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the largest men in the age of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
So this is, 49 surgery for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of the <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make to make the conversation go forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a choice many times, they want a shorter life -- they want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the time, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is they shut down a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very rapidly. They could get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go out of the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail sometimes.
The idea is to think about the future of how they might be able to be able to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
He went back to the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor and I installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit, I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages I've seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm managing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: The <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, I would never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little story.
The French signs came over the decade of the 1800s, and over the time of time, it mixed with the local notes, and we developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But I now realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, providing behaviors and <unk> standards.
So how do I understand the audio <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It was <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've learned for example.
"I don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of sound, which is to come next.
This drawing.
<unk>
It will go on to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to make this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings, I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I went in museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I was from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that we don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it very <unk> or I can experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and focus on my art practice.
And everything that had taught me at the way to sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body work.
And when I presented it to the art community, it was struck by the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the social currency <unk>
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to <unk> me and my artistic work, or I could be able to <unk>
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me, just like and become my voice.
In that way, I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many performers different <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and it becomes my voice.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, in order to <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a kind of a value of value as well as taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could get it into the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new art, <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> what means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you can understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> lies in many different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as the piano, as the facial expression movement, the speed, the shape of your hand and so while the piano, the English is a linear, language, as if it was <unk> just a key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a <unk> concept or an idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the world, it would create a completely different meaning of it.
Same thing happens with the music as to pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
oh. oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun, and you put it on.
This is <unk>
If you look at it and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel like the same thing can be said -- <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
And this represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how much your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, dramatic idea at the same time, let's give it one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times per capita.
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk>
Look at <unk> hand right -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands.
Now we're going to do both in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second thing that I'd like to show you is this -- I mean, please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third game, please get back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
You see how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they bring very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have any social value.
We need to start questioning what the social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> -- not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and to experience our visual language.
And you never know, can you even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents told me, "Can you get it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a picture of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults are also very good at getting clean the other one of the other.
Last time, I am now an adult and I teach citizenship and invention in the <unk> school.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of scary.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those little plastic bits for them to look at the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's very expensive to use those enormous scales.
So with my students, six to 15 years, we dreamed of making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> job of work with <unk> so that young children are also able to participate.
And I will tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope it works.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids will get a lot of the robots.
Then we started what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And transforming the light lights and web chambers on speech and <unk> in a floating robot that is moving through the water and on the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see those pieces of plastic that floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board is processing this image, and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this step step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would make it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news news, and the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe lower than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the world's largest forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the oil is also the brown color, and when you all <unk> it's very difficult to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of stuff that produce different, what can help to identify what there is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, and my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I can address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half, and maybe in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started with a huge <unk> giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear central nuclear central water.
And today, according to the reports one of 300 tons is still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems to be that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has to be safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course I didn't know the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks as well.
It might seem like they didn't do the serious work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> your whole life.
Along with them we discussed the <unk> data, and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from the <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this we could see that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organize an civil expedition the closest to nuclear central to date.
We zoom out to a half miles of nuclear, and with the air aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> with the sediment of the sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became so small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can basically build it almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the age of age to transforming their standard wheels in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> awful -- but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So the citizen scientists, creators, <unk> we need to make the next generation for the environment and people, and so that can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel parts, the other one of the silk dragline <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic thing.
One is <unk> over the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that will be free.
<unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But the living creatures are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we take all the information that would need it for every cell to work and to make it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects, like <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in the wild.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with <unk> pores are thin with <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that gets gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen, which represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect in working with the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthetic -- it shows in the two screens after me.
My work, in the simplest level, trying to bring these two visions of the world, leaving the assembly and approaching growth.
You're probably wondering why now?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where four different disciplines that offers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe we create.
Please meet the minds and my students' hands.
We designed objects, products, and tools and tools and tools and tools through scale, from scale, at a base of 24 meters in diameter with a base of 24 and the <unk> buildings, and graphics <unk> facts from genetically <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is only to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a <unk> fashion show, with <unk> they are <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> and no seams between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet is rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner called <unk>
That designers have access to this analytical analytical analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow them to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair to the same and comfortable chair also absorb sound.
The Carter teacher my collaborator, we went back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the dots of pressure in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but it is continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what matters.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God send the Earth to grow a tree that was <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, and they were out of the leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made it grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design do if objects get out of a <unk>
Tell them a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons per year because of organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune out their properties, we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures at a big scale, it was built a system with multiple fog <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single 3.5 percent material -- 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, it leaves dry to find a natural form of the contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process that were a byproduct of the printing process that appeared for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed genetically engineered in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with mesh problems, and if it extends even more, to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of shrimp husks into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for things designed for <unk> in the sea, and the life is <unk> and placed in the ground, will help grow a tree.
The fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility to create clothes for <unk> <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> table we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life that created <unk> made made of <unk> made out of biological form.
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid, liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological magnets.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops called <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never get <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution per design.
To hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help us <unk> these bacteria and to make it off their way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This <unk> system is <unk> when it stretches from one end to another one, it goes to 200 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer camp, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels -- bright channels with life in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the living matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the kidney tissue and destroy our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer made layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture within which it was <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts of a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, the <unk> of those fibers each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a tension, structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it within a box with sensors with insects, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the worm <unk>
And yet, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch. not within a box, we realized that they took a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the way we composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death on their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses it in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we could shape <unk> silk without boiling <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making templates for <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that gender worms are moving into more dark and more dark areas -- so we use a solar route out to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of the light and the heat, and the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to be <unk> with us.
We put them very carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
The biological silk on the silk <unk> <unk> give the entire pavilion out of this.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> silk <unk>
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions in the world.
What it takes us out of it, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new design era of design, a new era of creation, that leads us to a design inspired by nature to an nature inspired by the first time, which demands for us, for the first time, that we do in the nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and turned on websites -- also playing the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I was excited about the other thing, something totally different, and I was going to focus on it, and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And eventually, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions, and we would go to <unk>
Another reason why it caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was afraid to be afraid of engagement, or to be whether or <unk> or in my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to get me back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where it is, they learned about the culture.
Do you ask the first question to what do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk> that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow in different ways, you know, <unk> students are asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
Whether this question inspired children to dream about what might be, is not inspired to dream about everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adult adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You've got to be <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor in <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling the idea that every one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what is that thing and devote their life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that show its curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it has no goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> that's a <unk>
It could help us in three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was the ideal that was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
It will make any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a sort of <unk> to a community, we cannot be according to a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, which is that there is huge strengths going into this way.
Here's three superpowers are <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of both or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in our visualization of data, and travel, mathematics and design, mathematics and design.
<unk> is a company that creates gold <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea that it was unique by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
It comes up with new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> we became interested in something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and it means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new zone that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is an entire time <unk> and an independent writer as well.
As a child pianist, an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most quickly known one.
Before it turned to the <unk> <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the rather fine sales mechanics when their practices was starting out of their practices and this ability to write a compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to go to what you're going to give you even if at the end of the end, you get it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower -- is the adaptability. It is the adaptability. It is the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes sometimes the CEO of videos, so sometimes a <unk> of Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes it seems James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
Technology Magazine Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can help them to meet the needs of the market, the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three abilities that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have the right problem, and we need creative thinkers -- not conventional to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart.
<unk> off the belly knowing what they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in depth and put into ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that are going to deal with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, in the <unk> in large part of them are given to them to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you take away from this talk, I hope that this is this: <unk> with your inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, let's go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I tell you, "Do you have their many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important -- <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman called <unk> they brought them to a psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I didn't know about it until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who never had seen before.
The even more surprising thing.
If <unk> had been living today, we couldn't give him the more help than the fact that he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
You have antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, for cancer for HIV, for HIV, for <unk> for <unk>
But it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about it all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend their <unk> years or Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or being dear disease.
In America, Alzheimer's billion dollars costs 200 billion per year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spends on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and their costs of <unk> increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the world's first causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer cancer research that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more than Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but everyone is <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years, even scientists, by Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent, reduces the hope of life and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> about a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made out of molecules of protein.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the <unk> spots are falling down.
This makes the protein molecules beating each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the <unk> of what step is complex, like a bomb.
You can get a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we put it, and then create a drug that does it do.
Until recently, in the most part, the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, physical, physical, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new type of drugs that were tracking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some of the videos of what happened when they test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, they have protein molecules that stick between each other in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive <unk> but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We must notice that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and they help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was able to put this article on the Romantic <unk> column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try it back in the last night.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers will be <unk> to make <unk> more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
They are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really struck me with your partner what you like to do, or she said, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to anybody you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But nevertheless, we got ourselves and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Romantic love column, in a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I suppose some of you probably asked that some of you probably wonder, they keep up with them.
And the reason why I think is to challenge this is because they've done this question again and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was put on the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience in love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and I thought that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousands of noticed.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But it had no idea.
The article was released on a Friday night, and the Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, Sunday, me had called the "Today Show and "Good <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million <unk> and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the trust writing about own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> keep <unk>
And so many messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on the radio, and I was <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed until the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> their own life.
In fact, the New York Times ran an article by San <unk> that included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> for photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range of <unk> for the one that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really did it, they wanted to know if it was actually able to make love -- not just an adventure, but love real, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, most of all, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if it was together, or not <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 <unk> more interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, it was looking for interpersonal approach, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic sounds right?
But the study worked.
The participants became more close after doing so, several studies later -- they also used <unk> protocol -- as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people from working political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> by it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom I do it.
Well, he did.
I think she just wants to be friends.
I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> I knew they managed to get better after test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that any of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation to it.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to know about my adult life, and he was my first real love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to the science.
And I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I only did it for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems to be really <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more <unk> I am more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably they can demand me.
What I'm looking for for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> upon the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wanted when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story told the media about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very daunting story, because in love it makes us feel <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that is, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, you know that let's make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you keep in love when things were <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more controversial conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit on the reading now, not because it wasn't true, but because at the moment, it had nothing that I was supposed to do.
I didn't think that a few times would we have to make that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have made and responded <unk> <unk> <unk> I chose to love somebody so generous, kind and fun and <unk> that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what you would have to do, and what maybe I will spend my life for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
New York City a time.  One thing that really affected me, but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later, and we would see how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example, how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has the grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and make and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I took it all the pages and made a kind of <unk> I went to Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to the bees and it is <unk> and so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, something happened. In some way it seemed to be a size, as if we were to get the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add elements of electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I would find on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw like a dead <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals <unk>
First of all, you start to be able to make an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was cool, man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings in layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window and then on the other window and another window, and he had all these windows together that make it a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very large, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired as a lot of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Ten meters long.
It's got double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, with this <unk> mesh of the <unk>
Here is where the creatures with animals of animals are heading into the <unk> ready for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform, the <unk> platform, the <unk> shelter -- there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also sort of a <unk> species.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out in a hand while on the other hand, the clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps Earth and cosmos in balance.
So it's one of the <unk>
It's a narrative of story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail.
Anyway, its tail turn on fire in a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things I go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a ocular <unk> made out of <unk> cards of 1986.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds of being caught in the inside.
This is a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> he's your chest, you can get the ticket.
I'm going to see it for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick overview of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see them.
This is a party body in half.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue coming in.
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
Can you be <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a <unk> arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of the <unk> of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill actually has an effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system for any drug to put in the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are <unk> to decrease the amount of virus in blood, and increase the bacterial cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects, in their most negative, because in the time that it takes you to get to your blood current -- it will be <unk> and worse for the time that it takes to get to their destination, which is where it's more important -- at the HIV farm.
These are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily enter the blood bloodstream.
However, after the disease disruption is able to wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
So this is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life by running an oral treatment.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, make the treatment directly into the supply of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for caring for wounds and surgery -- they can be used for anything, including the drug transport of medicines.
In fact, we are already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, and open and close and close the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are going, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser beam on the cellular membrane of HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drug drugs.
The laser cuts through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, he goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the pill that releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not by armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They are doing what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the better to these pulse generators.
I do business work in the politics of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed between a state and an actor not government <unk>
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons why they do that, but nobody analyzes what they do when they didn't exist.
The armed struggle and the political struggle and the political struggle <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s -- <unk> has also established a political game, a social service network and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> who was known for their suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking now."
It <unk> a complex machinery of communication stations and TV channels on TV websites and web websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to get better and build their brand.
The armed groups also make something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn through the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high income price for the population.
But, in general, provide social services to fill a vacuum -- a <unk> gap by government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they have <unk> gaps per government, and they emerge as the armed and political groups, engaging in the violent struggle and bring governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, we can be <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It turns out a part of a territory, run all of their <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations and <unk> and the weakest of the <unk> are the states, like in the Middle East and the <unk> and they fill that gap the actors not government.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in a military tools.
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand our groups that we will understand better what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors and actors know, military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that vacuum emptiness to fill that vacuum vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was struck by a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women, <unk> women with the men and <unk> sex as if that was bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was used to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who calls too much self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
Let's get the same pay.
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use it easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have the other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality -- our social condition and a lot more.
We need to have to figure out these differences and how do we behave the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be <unk> I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and the morning, deeply, the classic <unk> the classic <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
It was actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry isn't it?
I'm completely <unk> by my music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks but also killing insects -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, it is his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides if a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, I accepted that election, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional wisdom, which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- gay workers, gay and <unk> for white women and high school women.
Listen, if that's a good feminism is a very bad <unk>
It also happens to happen, as a feminist, I feel a lot of <unk>
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of good from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider that <unk> before I try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what it means that this tag was because of not being able to fulfill the little bit realistic style.
Let's take for example to <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist name.
In the <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> from three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show you see this star in embracing embracing the feminism and asking women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless debates if they were <unk> or not exactly a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we need a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a Feminism is <unk>
But what happens next?
We were able to recognize our <unk> to give the word back and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happily providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have their music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when bad decisions justify that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
It's two girls and <unk> and bright girls, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And where they were <unk> for the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio electron when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treated more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes deal with their peers as linoleum <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post it in his magazine, to participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be involved in these kinds of projects, we can also empower being including as much as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the <unk> people in the power of CEOs and language producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people that can make great decisions, more brave and significant change.
We can also tell the courage with our good, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist at not to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated like anything.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was overwhelmed with a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
And I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and the feminism also found that if it was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In a hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other hand, I propose the concluded that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need a little bit of it.
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> by having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, allowing over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with a immune immune system, is one of the most <unk> diseases.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines that were <unk> disqualified and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents all around the world keep <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth estimates in time.
For the most part of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creating their entire professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates went stable as well only three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising funds like <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could get it from another child in <unk>
So what's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people in the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son two years, the visual contact.
If the criteria of diagnostic had to be <unk> why were it so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and focus on the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told me a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> on an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> private worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could amuse him for hours waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey to the panic for <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in your usual place without knowing it.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared seen less than 150 cases of his syndrome as a <unk> of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis for children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
It was once <unk> that he had turned nine from every 10 children to his office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> caused by cold parents, <unk>
These kids, he said, they have remained carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't exist.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, claiming things like children were simply <unk> what they heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
<unk> not until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> the cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers -- of <unk> -- was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and warm, and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed services without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend ourselves in the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They started a prevalence of prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse of autism was a lot.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for the astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year on the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was no one or an English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German was German -- and he did it for it.
The paper offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music games, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, diagnosed the described as disability as disability in life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and they started to help in the developing methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> seen autism as a continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in <unk> culture as awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there even until I say, the success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
Now, Judith found that I was very wrong when autism was <unk> so that the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the criteria of diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes turned into <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> by a wide and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fall in <unk>
I was <unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out with <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a little circle, <unk> experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, and parents all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, the first animal tests are introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for their son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were hoping that it was that it was able to make people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful story, and <unk> credible history as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If you have the estimate of the heart center that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving by new advances -- the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the strains of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of operating operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and there's a attention deficit deficit to detail.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still achieving <unk> that believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities, of support, and parents with faith in their own children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck for <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
